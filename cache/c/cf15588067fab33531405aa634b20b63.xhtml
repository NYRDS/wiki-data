## Verification Process
</p>

<p>
Performed a comprehensive verification of the Remixed Dungeon wiki content:
</p>

<p>
1. Read the WIKI_DOCUMENTATION.md to understand the wiki system
2. Pulled and analyzed recent changes from the wiki-data submodule
3. Selected and verified random wiki pages against the codebase:
</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> amok_arrow.txt: Verified accuracy of implementation details</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> sacrificial_sword.txt: Verified accuracy of implementation details</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> buffs.txt: Verified accuracy of implementation details</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> range.txt: Verified accuracy of implementation details</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> spirit_of_pain.txt: Verified accuracy of implementation details</div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
4. Checked all images in wiki pages - no broken image references found
5. Checked backlinks and redlinks - identified 875 red links (mostly in Russian section)
6. Checked for duplicate content - no content duplicates found at higher thresholds
7. Verified naming patterns follow conventions (e.g., _mob, _subclass suffixes)
</p>

<p>
