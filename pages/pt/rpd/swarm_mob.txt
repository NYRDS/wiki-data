====== Swarm Mob ======

{{ rpd:images:swarm_mob.png|Swarm }}

The **Swarm** is a group of small insects that act as a single enemy unit in Remixed Dungeon. It's an unusual mob that splits into multiple smaller swarms when defeated.

==== Overview ====
A Swarm consists of dozens of small insects that appear as a single creature but function differently from typical mobs. The Swarm is immune to most status effects due to its nature as a collection of small creatures. According to the game description, "The deadly swarm of flies buzzes angrily. Every non-magical attack will split it into two smaller but equally dangerous swarms."

==== Stats ====
  * **HP:** 80 (HT: 80)
  * **Defense Skill:** 5
  * **Attack Skill:** 12
  * **Damage:** 1-4
  * **Armor:** 0 DR (Defense Rating)
  * **EXP for Kill:** 7 (varies based on splitting)
  * **Maximum Level:** 10
  * **Characteristics:** Immune to most status effects (poison, paralysis, etc.), flying

==== Abilities ====
  * **Splitting:** When hurt (but not killed), splits into smaller swarms based on damage taken, each with remaining HP
  * **Immunity:** Immune to most status effects due to its swarm nature
  * **Flying:** Can move over terrain that blocks other creatures
  * **Loot:** May drop a Potion of Healing at a chance that decreases with each generation of the split swarm

==== Occurrence ====
  * **Primary Location:** Found throughout the Prison level and other dungeon levels
  * **Spawn Frequency:**
    * Sewer Level: 2% chance (level 3)
    * Prison Level: 1 in level 6, 1 in level 7, 1 in level 8, 1 in level 9
  * **Group Behavior:** Usually found alone

==== Strategy ====
  * Use area-of-effect attacks or spells to damage multiple swarms at once
  * Focus on one swarm at a time to prevent multiplication
  * Magic-based attacks (like wands) work better than physical attacks to avoid splitting
  * Fire-based attacks and AoE spells work well against swarms
  * Be careful not to let them split multiple times, leading to a large number of enemies
  * Area effect attacks like the [[pt:rpd:scroll_of_psionic_blast_item|Scroll of Psionic Blast]], [[pt:rpd:scroll_of_fire_item|Scroll of Fire]], or [[pt:rpd:ignite_spell|Ignite Spell]] can be very effective

==== Special Notes ====
  * The splitting mechanic can lead to exponential multiplication if not handled carefully
  * Due to its nature, many status effects are ineffective against swarms
  * Swarms are generally not very dangerous individually but can overwhelm with numbers
  * Each generation of split swarms has decreasing chances of dropping healing potions
