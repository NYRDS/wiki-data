====== Mana ======

Mana is a magical resource in Remixed Dungeon that enables the casting of spells and use of magical abilities.

==== Description ====
Mana represents the spiritual energy required to cast spells. It's a resource that certain classes and spells use, though the game doesn't have a traditional mana pool system like other RPGs.

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Skill Points System:** The game uses a skill point system rather than traditional mana
  * **Spell Costs:** Different spells consume specific amounts of skill points when cast
  * **Regeneration:** Skill points regenerate over time through the [[rpd:mana_regeneration|Mana Regeneration]] buff
  * **Restoration:** [[rpd:mana_potion|Mana Potions]] restore skill points when consumed (gives 1/3 of max skill points)

==== Classes That Use Mana ====
  * Classes with magical affinities use skill points to cast spells
  * [[rpd:mage|Mages]] - Use skill points for elemental spells
  * [[rpd:necromancer|Necromancers]] - Use skill points for necromancy spells
  * [[rpd:rogue|Rogues]] - Use skill points for rogue-affinity spells
  * Other classes with spell access also use skill points

==== Items and Restoration ====
  * [[rpd:mana_potion|Mana Potion]] - Drink to restore skill points (gives 1/3 of max skill points)
  * [[rpd:potion_of_mana|Potion of Mana]] - Alchemy ingredient for creating mana potions
  * Equipment may provide bonuses to skill point regeneration

==== Regeneration ====
  * [[rpd:mana_regeneration|Mana Regeneration]] - Buff that passively accumulates skill points
  * Regenerates 1 skill point every 20/(1.2^bonus) turns (faster with bonuses)
  * Regeneration rate is affected by buffs and game facilitations
  * Does not regenerate in unsafe areas (when enemies are present)

==== Spells and Abilities ====
  * [[rpd:spells|Spells]] - Various magical abilities that consume skill points
  * Different spells have different costs (e.g., Cloak spell costs 5 skill points)
  * Spell costs and mechanics are defined in Lua scripts

==== Strategy ====
  * Manage skill points carefully during extended fights
  * Carry [[rpd:mana_potion|Mana Potions]] for magic-heavy sections
  * Balance offensive spells with skill point conservation
  * Consider equipment that improves skill point regeneration
