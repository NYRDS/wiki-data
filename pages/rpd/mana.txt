====== Mana ======

**Mana** is the magical energy resource used by spellcasters in Remixed Dungeon. It is required for casting most spells and some magical abilities.

==== Mechanics ====
  * Used to cast spells
  * Naturally regenerates over time when not in combat
  * Different spells cost different amounts of mana
  * Some rings and equipment affect mana capacity or regeneration

==== Regeneration ====
  * Regenerates slowly during rest (not during combat)
  * Some items and rings can improve regeneration rate
  * Certain conditions can slow or stop mana regeneration

==== Equipment Interactions ====
  * **Ring of Mana**: Improves mana regeneration
  * **Potion of Mana**: Instantly restores mana
  * Various other equipment can affect mana mechanics
