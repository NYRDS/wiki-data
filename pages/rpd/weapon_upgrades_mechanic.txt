====== Weapon Upgrades ======

Weapon upgrades are enhancement levels that increase the base stats of weapons in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Upgrade Mechanics ====
Weapons can be upgraded to improve their performance:

  * **Positive Upgrades** - Each positive level increases damage output and may improve other stats
  * **Negative Upgrades** - Each negative level decreases damage output and performance
  * **Curses** - Negative effects that can be applied to weapons (removed when upgrading)

==== Positive Upgrades ====
Each positive upgrade level provides:
  * Increased damage range (specific formula varies by weapon type)
  * No change to attack speed (DLY property remains constant)
  * Better overall performance
  * Higher chance of success when fighting enemies

==== Negative Upgrades ====
Negative upgrades result in:
  * Reduced damage output
  * No change to attack speed
  * Lower overall performance

==== Acquisition ====
  * **Scroll of Upgrade** - Applies a single upgrade level to any upgradable item (weapon, armor, ring)
    * Also removes curses from the item
    * Does not add enchantments to weapons
  * **Scroll of Weapon Upgrade** - Applies a single upgrade level specifically to weapons
    * Also removes curses from the weapon
    * May add a random enchantment to the weapon when upgraded
  * **Shop purchases** - Occasionally found in higher-level shops
  * **Treasure drops** - Higher-level weapons may spawn upgraded

==== Strategy ====
  * Balance upgrade level with your strength requirements (STR stat needed to wield)
  * Prioritize upgrading your main weapon for maximum impact
  * For weapons with high upgrade levels, ensure you can meet strength requirements
  * Consider that upgrading a weapon with an enchantment might remove the enchantment

==== Preservation ====
  * **Scroll of Remove Curse** - Can remove curses but doesn't directly downgrade items
  * Upgrading removes curses from items automatically
