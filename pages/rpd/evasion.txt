====== Evasion ======

Evasion is the ability to avoid attacks in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Description ====
Evasion is a defensive mechanic that determines the chance to completely avoid incoming attacks. Higher evasion increases the likelihood of dodging enemy attacks, reducing damage taken.

==== Evasion Mechanics ====
  * **Chance Based**: Evasion works as a percentage chance to completely avoid damage
  * **Calculation**: Chance to evade is based on defender's evasion vs attacker's accuracy
  * **Application**: Successful evasion results in no damage taken from the attack
  * **Equipment**: Certain items can enhance evasion capabilities

==== Evasion Sources ====
  * **Equipment**: Some armor and accessories provide evasion bonuses
  * **Rings**: [[rpd:ring_of_evasion_item|Ring of Evasion]] specifically increases evasion
  * **Enchantments**: Certain armor glyphs can enhance evasion
  * **Buffs**: Temporary effects may increase evasion during certain situations

==== Evasion Factors ====
  * **Armor**: Some armor types provide better evasion than others
  * **Agility**: Some character classes have natural agility bonuses
  * **Speed**: Faster characters may have slightly better evasion
  * **Positioning**: Tactical positioning can complement high evasion
