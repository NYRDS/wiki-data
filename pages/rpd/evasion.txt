====== Evasion ======

Evasion is the ability to avoid attacks in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Description ====
Evasion is a defensive mechanic that determines the chance to completely avoid incoming attacks. Higher evasion increases the likelihood of dodging enemy attacks, reducing damage taken.

==== Evasion Mechanics ====
  * **Calculation Formula**: Evasion multiplier = 1.2^bonus, where bonus comes from evasion-enhancing equipment/buffs
  * **Armor Penalty**: Heavier armor (with required STR higher than hero's STR) reduces evasion by dividing it by 1.5^encumbrance
  * **Class Bonus**: Rogues get a 2x evasion multiplier when they are a Freerunner subclass and not starving
  * **Paralysis Effect**: When paralyzed, evasion is halved
  * **Application**: Successful evasion results in no damage taken from the attack

==== Evasion Sources ====
  * **Rings**: [[rpd:ring_of_evasion_item|Ring of Evasion]] provides bonus to evasion calculation
  * **Buffs**: Various buffs can provide evasion bonuses
  * **Hero Subclass**: [[rpd:freerunner_subclass|Freerunner]] subclass provides evasion bonus for Rogues

==== Evasion Factors ====
  * **Equipment Bonus**: Evasion bonus is calculated as 1.2^bonus, where bonus is the sum of all evasion-enhancing equipment
  * **Armor Weight**: Heavier armor reduces evasion based on the formula: evasion / (1.5^encumbrance)
  * **Rogue Subclass**: Freerunner subclass doubles evasion when not starving
  * **Paralysis Status**: Halves evasion when paralyzed
