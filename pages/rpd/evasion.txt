====== Evasion ======

Evasion is a core combat mechanic in Remixed Pixel Dungeon that represents a character's ability to avoid attacks entirely. Higher evasion increases the chance to dodge enemy attacks, making it particularly valuable against strong enemies.

==== Evasion Statistics ====
  * **Evasion Rating**: Calculated from Dexterity (DEX) stat and equipment bonuses
  * **Dexterity**: The primary stat affecting evasion chance
  * **Armor Penalty**: Heavier armor reduces evasion effectiveness

==== Factors Affecting Evasion ====
  * **Dexterity Points**: Each point in DEX provides a certain evasion bonus
  * **Light Armor**: Lighter armor (like cloth or leather) penalizes evasion less than heavy armor
  * **Equipment**: Certain rings and items can boost evasion
  * **Buff Effects**: Temporary evasion boosts from various status effects

==== Evasion Calculation ====
The game uses a formula that takes into account the character's dexterity, armor type, and any evasion-enhancing items to calculate the probability of avoiding an enemy attack.

==== Benefits of High Evasion ====
  * **Damage Avoidance**: Complete avoidance of damage from dodged attacks
  * **Combat Efficiency**: Less healing required during battles
  * **Risk Mitigation**: Particularly valuable against high-damage enemies
  * **Resource Conservation**: Preserve valuable potions and scrolls during combat

==== Class Considerations ====
  * **Rogue**: Benefits significantly from high evasion with starting DEX bonus
  * **Huntress**: Natural bonus to dexterity makes evasion effective
  * **Other Classes**: Can utilize evasion but may prioritize other stats

==== Equipment with Evasion Bonuses ====
  * **Light Armor**: Preferred for characters prioritizing evasion
  * **Rings of Evasion**: Directly increase evasion chances
  * **Pendants**: Some accessories provide evasion bonuses
