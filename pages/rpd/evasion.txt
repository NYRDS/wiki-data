====== Evasion ======

**Evasion** is a core combat statistic in Remixed Dungeon that determines the chance to avoid being hit by enemy attacks. It works in opposition to [[rpd:accuracy|Accuracy]] to determine whether attacks land successfully.

==== Calculation ====
Evasion is calculated in the ''Char.java'' file in the ''defenseSkill'' method. The formula involves:

  * **Base Defense Skill**: Determined by character level and class
  * **Equipment Bonus**: From items like [[rpd:ring_of_evasion_item|Ring of Evasion]]
  * **Mobility**: Affected by the character's movement speed
  * **Armor Penalty**: Heavier armor may reduce evasion effectiveness

==== Impact on Combat ====
  * **Hit Avoidance**: Higher evasion means more enemy attacks miss
  * **Survivability**: Critical for surviving encounters with powerful enemies
  * **Passive Defense**: Provides protection without requiring active player input
  * **Melee vs Ranged**: Affects both types of incoming attacks

==== Equipment with Evasion Benefits ====
  * [[rpd:ring_of_evasion_item|Ring of Evasion]] - Primary source of evasion bonus
  * Lightweight armor that doesn't impose significant penalties
  * Certain [[rpd:boots_item|Boots]] that provide movement benefits

==== Related Mechanics ====
  * [[rpd:accuracy|Accuracy]] - The opposing stat that determines hit chance
  * [[rpd:defence|Defense]] - Reduces damage from successful hits
  * [[rpd:combat_mechanic|Combat]] - Overall combat system
  * [[rpd:mechanics#enemy_ai|Enemy AI]] - Some enemies may have special mechanics against evasion

  * **Implementation Location:** [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/watabou/pixeldungeon/actors/Char.java|Char.java]] (defenseSkill method)
  * **Combat Resolution:** Combined with accuracy to determine if attacks connect
