====== Evasion Mechanic ======

Evasion is a core combat mechanic in Remixed Pixel Dungeon that represents a character's ability to avoid attacks entirely. Higher evasion increases the chance to dodge enemy attacks, making it particularly valuable against strong enemies.

==== Evasion Calculation ====
Evasion is implemented through the defenseSkill method in Char.java, where defensive bonus is calculated using the formula:

```

float evasion = (float) Math.pow(1.2, bonus)

```

Where 'bonus' is the sum of any defenceSkillBonus from active buffs.

==== Factors Affecting Evasion ====
  * **Dexterity**: Higher level characters naturally have better defense
  * **Armor Penalty**: If armor required STR exceeds effective STR, evasion is reduced by 1.5^penalty
  * **Equipment**: Rings and other items can provide defenceSkillBonus
  * **Buff Effects**: Temporary evasion boosts from various status effects

==== Equipment with Evasion Bonuses ====
  * **[[rpd:ring_of_evasion_item|Ring of Evasion]]**: Provides +1 defenceSkillBonus per ring level
  * **[[rpd:freerunner_subclass|Freerunner Subclass]]**: Doubles evasion bonus when not starving and in motion
