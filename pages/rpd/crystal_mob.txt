====== Crystal (Mob) ======

The **Crystal** is a special magical enemy found in Remixed Pixel Dungeon, often associated with the Shadow Lord.

==== Description ====
Crystals are magical constructs that serve Shadow Lord and other powerful entities in the dungeon. They possess magical abilities and can be quite dangerous in combat.

==== Stats ====
* HP: Moderate to High
* Defense: Moderate
* Attack: Magical attacks
* Speed: Moderate
* Special: Magical abilities, possibly related to Shadow Lord

==== Tactics ====
Crystals use magical attacks rather than physical ones, so magical resistance or armor can be helpful. They may also be connected to the Shadow Lord encounter, so defeating them could affect the boss battle in some way.
