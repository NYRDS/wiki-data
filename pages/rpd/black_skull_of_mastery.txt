The **Black Skull of Mastery** is a special quest item in Remixed Dungeon that allows Necromancer players to select a subclass for their character.

==== Item Overview ====
  * **Type:** Quest Item
  * **Rarity:** Unique
  * **Special Effect:** Unlocks subclass selection for Necromancer class
  * **Acquisition:** Dropped by the Lich boss in Necropolis

==== Special Mechanics ====
  * When used, the Black Skull of Mastery allows the Necromancer to choose between [[rpd:lich|Lich]] and [[rpd:witchdoctor|Witchdoctor]] subclasses
  * This item is specific to the Necromancer class and can only be used by Necromancer characters
  * The subclass choice is permanent and defines special mechanics and abilities for the rest of the run
  * Unlike the [[rpd:tome_of_mastery|Tome of Mastery]], which is used by most other classes, Necromancer uses this special item instead

==== Classes That Use the Black Skull of Mastery ====
  * **Necromancer:** [[rpd:lich|Lich]] or [[rpd:witchdoctor|Witchdoctor]]

==== Strategy ====
  * Save the skull until you've assessed your current equipment and situation
  * Consider your current playstyle and equipment when choosing a subclass
  * The Lich subclass provides different abilities compared to the Witchdoctor subclass
  * You can only have one subclass, so choose carefully as the decision is permanent for the run
