**Food** items in Remixed Dungeon satisfy the hero's hunger, preventing the negative effects of starving and maintaining optimal performance.

==== Description ====
Food items are essential survival items that provide hunger satisfaction to the hero. Without adequate food, the hero will eventually starve, which reduces effectiveness in combat and exploration.

==== Properties ====
  * **Hunger Satisfaction:** Amount of hunger restored when consumed
  * **Nutrition Value:** How much hunger points are recovered
  * **Stackable:** Most food items are stackable to save inventory space
  * **Shelf Life:** Some food items can eventually become rotten if not consumed

==== Food Types ====
  * [[rpd:ration_item|Rations]] - Basic food item with moderate hunger restoration
  * [[rpd:overpriced_ration_item|Overpriced Ration]] - Expensive version sold in shops
  * [[rpd:mystery_meat_item|Mystery Meat]] - Unknown effect, can provide various benefits or negative effects
  * [[rpd:chargrilled_meat_item|Chargrilled Meat]] - Safe version of mystery meat
  * [[rpd:freeze_carpaccio_item|Frozen Carpaccio]] - Provides healing and fullness
  * [[rpd:pasty_item|Pasty]] - More nutritious than basic rations
  * [[rpd:pseudo_pasty_item|Pseudo Pasty]] - Alternative to pasty with different effects
  * [[rpd:rotten_food_item|Rotten Food]] - Harmful to consume, causes negative effects

==== Effects When Consumed ====
  * **Hunger Satisfaction:** Restores hunger points to prevent starvation penalties
  * **Possible Side Effects:** Some foods provide additional temporary benefits or detriments
  * **Satiation:** Prevents the hunger status from decreasing for a period

==== Preservation ====
  * Some food items will eventually rot if not consumed quickly enough
  * Rotten food items provide negative effects when consumed
  * [[rpd:potion_of_purity_item|Potion of Purity]] can purify rotten food items

==== Food Strategy ====
  * **Conservation:** Conserve food for later dungeon levels where resources are scarcer
  * **Variety:** Different food items provide different benefits in addition to hunger satisfaction
  * **Efficiency:** Consider the nutrition-to-weight ratio when deciding which food to carry
  * **Risk vs Reward:** Mystery meat provides unknown effects - weigh the potential benefits against the risk of negative effects
