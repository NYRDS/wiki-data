====== Food ======

Food is consumable items that satisfy the hero's hunger in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Description ====
Food items restore the hero's hunger status, which is essential for maintaining health and performance. Without adequate nutrition, the hero will become hungry, weak, and eventually start losing health.

==== Food Types ====
  * **Standard Rations** - Basic food with modest benefits
  * **Specialty Food** - Enhanced nutrition with additional benefits
  * **Quest Food** - Special food items related to specific quests
  * **Spoiled Food** - Food that has gone bad and may be harmful

==== Common Mechanics ====
  * **Hunger Restoration**: Food restores the hunger bar which prevents health drain
  * **Nutrition Value**: Different foods provide different amounts of nutrition
  * **Spoilage**: Some food items can become rotten over time
  * **Special Effects**: Certain food items provide temporary beneficial effects
