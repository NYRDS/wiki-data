{{ rpd:images:ration_sprite.png|Food }}

**Food** items in Remixed Dungeon satisfy hunger and keep the hero in good health. Without food, the hero will become hungry, weak, and eventually start losing health.

==== Food Types ====
  * [[rpd:ration|Iron Ration]] - Standard food item that fully satisfies hunger
  * [[rpd:overpriced_ration|Overpriced Ration]] - Expensive food from shops, smaller effect
  * [[rpd:rotten_food|Rotten Food]] - Dangerous food that poisons the hero
  * [[rpd:rotten_ration|Rotten Ration]] - Rotten version of Iron Ration
  * [[rpd:freeze_carpaccio|Frozen Carpaccio]] - Special food that heals and cures status effects
  * [[rpd:mystery_meat|Mystery Meat]] - Food with random effects (good or bad)
  * [[rpd:chargrilled_meat|Chargrilled Meat]] - Cooked meat from cooking Mystery Meat
  * [[rpd:food|Food]] - The generic food item

==== Hunger Mechanics ====
  * Eating food fully satisfies hunger
  * Each food item provides 3000 hunger points (satiety)
  * Without food, hunger increases until the hero starts losing health
  * [[rpd:hunger|Hunger]] system details
