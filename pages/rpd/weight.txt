====== Weight ======

Weight refers to the burden system in Remixed Dungeon that affects the hero's movement speed and ability to carry items.

==== Weight Mechanics ====
  * Every item has a weight value
  * Carrying too much weight slows the hero down
  * Maximum carrying capacity is based on strength

==== Weight Categories ====
  * **Light Load (0-1.0x)**: No movement penalty, normal speed
  * **Medium Load (1.0-2.0x)**: 1.5x slower than normal
  * **Heavy Load (2.0-3.0x)**: 2x slower than normal
  * **Overloaded (>3.0x)**: 3x slower than normal, can't run

==== Managing Weight ====
  * Stronger heroes can carry more weight before penalties
  * [[rpd:ring_of_haggler_item|Ring of Haggler]] can reduce item weight
  * Upgrade strength with [[rpd:potion_of_strength_item|Potions of Strength]] to carry more
  * Drop unnecessary items to reduce weight

==== Item Weights ====
  * Gold weighs 0.0 per gold piece
  * [[rpd:weapons_mechanic|Weapons]] and [[rpd:armor|Armor]] typically have higher weights
  * [[rpd:potions|Potions]] and [[rpd:scrolls|Scrolls]] weigh 1 each
  * [[rpd:food|Food]] items typically weigh 1-2
  * Lighter items are generally more efficient to carry

==== Strategy ====
  * Prioritize high-value, low-weight items
  * Avoid over-carrying unnecessary equipment
  * Consider leaving items in your tomb when upgrading
  * Balance carrying useful items vs. maintaining mobility
