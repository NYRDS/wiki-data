====== Blindness ======

{{ rpd:images:blindness_buff.png|Blindness }}

**Blindness** is a debuff in Remixed Dungeon that reduces a character's accuracy and detection abilities. When affected by blindness, characters have reduced ability to hit targets and may have limited vision.

==== Description ====
When a character is affected by Blindness, their accuracy is significantly reduced, making it harder to hit enemies in combat. The effect also impacts their ability to detect enemies and navigate the dungeon effectively. When the blindness effect ends, the character's vision is recalibrated.

==== Effects ====
  * **Reduced Accuracy:** Significantly decreases the chance to hit enemies in combat
  * **Limited Vision:** Reduces the character's field of vision
  * **Detection Issues:** Makes it harder to detect nearby enemies and objects
  * **Vision Recalibration:** When the effect ends, the character needs to re-observe their surroundings

==== How to Get ====
  * **Wand of Lightning:** Can apply blindness as a side effect
  * **Scroll of Terror:** May cause temporary blindness when enemies are affected
  * **Enemy Abilities:** Some enemies have attacks that induce blindness
  * **Traps:** Certain traps in the dungeon can cause blindness
  * **Status Effects:** Can be triggered by certain magical effects

==== Counters ====
  * **Potion of Purity:** Can cleanse the blindness effect
  * **Ring of Satiety:** May provide some resistance to blindness
  * **Duration:** The effect wears off over time
