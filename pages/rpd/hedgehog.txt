====== Hedgehog ======

{{ rpd:images:hedgehog_sprite.png|Hedgehog Sprite }}

==== Description ====
That hedgehog seems nervous.

==== Stats ====
  * **Speed:** Starts at 0.5, increases by 0.5 with each interaction
  * **Attack/Defense:** Not applicable (NPC)
  * **Damage Immunity:** The Hedgehog is immune to all damage

==== Behavior ====
Hedgehog is an NPC that appears on level 23 of the dungeon. It's a unique character with a special interaction sequence:

  - **First interaction:** Says "Are you looking for Bear too?"
  - **Second interaction:** Says "How's Horse, there, in the mist?"
  - **Third interaction:** Says "Do You like tea with raspberry jam?"
  - **Fourth interaction:** Says "Take this pie" and drops a [[rpd:pasty|Pasty]]
  - **Subsequent interactions:** Says "I'm late, I'm terribly late..." and increases speed to 3

There is no practical benefit from the Hedgehog, but he can give the player a [[rpd:pasty|Pasty]]. After receiving the pie, the only thing that the Hedgehog will do is to act as a human shield against the long-range Scorpio attacks. This should not occur often, because the Hedgehog is extremely fast and you just won't have time to run after him.

==== Special Notes ====
  * Only spawns once per game on level 23
  * Will not attack players
  * After giving the Pasty, moves faster and eventually disappears
  * Does not take damage from any source
