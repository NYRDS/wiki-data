The **Warrior** is one of the starting [[rpd:hero_classes|hero classes]] in Remixed Dungeon. The Warrior is a melee-focused class that specializes in the use of weapons and armor to tackle enemies head-on.

==== Description ====
The Warrior is a classic melee fighter who starts with a unique short sword that can be later upgraded and a small health bonus. The class is designed for direct combat and is often considered the most beginner-friendly class due to its straightforward approach to combat and good survivability.

  * **Max Inventory:** 19 slots

==== Special Abilities ====
  * **Starting Weapon:** The Warrior starts with a Short Sword +1 (identified), which can be upgraded with scrolls.

  * [[rpd:gladiator_subclass|Gladiator]]
  * [[rpd:berserker_subclass|Berserker]]

==== Note about Page Naming ====
This page follows the current wiki convention for hero class pages using the `_class` suffix. If you arrived here from an old link, please note that hero class pages now use the format `class_name_class.txt` (e.g., `warrior_class.txt`, `mage_class.txt`) instead of just `class_name.txt`.

==== Advantages ====
  * Better starting HP and strength than other classes
  * Unique Short Sword provides an early combat advantage
  * Good survivability with high HP
  * Access to armor and defensive items

==== Disadvantages ====
  * Lacks ranged combat options
  * Relies on direct confrontation
  * No magical abilities for utility

==== Strategy ====
  * Use your HP advantage to engage enemies more aggressively
  * Focus on upgrading your unique Short Sword when possible
  * Invest in armor early for maximum protection
  * Take advantage of the higher strength to use better equipment
  * Consider your subclass choice carefully based on your playstyle
