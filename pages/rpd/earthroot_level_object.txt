==== Description ====
The Earthroot level object is a passive level object that provides a protective "Barkskin" buff to any character that touches it. When a character steps on the tile containing an Earthroot level object, they gain temporary armor.

==== Effects ====
  * Provides the [[rpd:barkskin_buff|Barkskin]] buff when touched
  * The barkskin effect provides temporary armor that reduces incoming damage
  * The effect is immediate when stepping on the level object tile
  * The level object disappears after being touched

==== Mechanics ====
  * Earthroot level objects are typically found growing in the dungeon
  * They can also be grown by planting [[rpd:earthroot_seed_item|Earthroot Seeds]]
  * The barkskin effect from the level object is proportional to the character's max HP

==== Strategy ====
  * Earthroot level objects are valuable for providing defensive benefits in dangerous areas
  * Consider saving them for challenging encounters or boss fights
  * Can be especially helpful before entering dangerous rooms or areas
