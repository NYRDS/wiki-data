  * **Zapping:** Use action to activate the wand's effect
  * **Durability:** Wands can break after extended use

==== Strategy ====
  * **Charge Management:** Be mindful of remaining charges
  * **Tactical Use:** Wands can be used defensively as well as offensively
  * **Upgrading Priority:** Often worth upgrading early for consistent effects
  * **Class Synergy:** [[rpd:mage_class|Mages]] and [[rpd:warlock|Warlocks]] benefit most from wand use
