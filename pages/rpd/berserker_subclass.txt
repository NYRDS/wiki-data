====== Berserker Subclass ======

{{ rpd:images:hero_WARRIOR_BERSERKER.png|Berserker Subclass }}

The **Berserker** is the Warrior's subclass in Remixed Dungeon. This mastery path focuses on high-risk, high-reward combat, becoming significantly more powerful when severely wounded.

==== Unlocking ====
The Berserker subclass can be unlocked by using a [[rpd:tome_of_mastery|Tome of Mastery]] after defeating the second boss (Tengu). The Tome of Mastery is typically obtained by defeating the second boss (Tengu) in the dungeon.

==== Special Mechanics ====
When severely wounded (below 40% health), the Berserker enters a state of wild fury significantly increasing his damage output (attack damage is doubled). The Fury buff is automatically applied when the Berserker drops below 40% health while still having some HP, and wears off when the health rises above 40% again.

==== Special Armor ====
Using an [[rpd:armor_kit|Armor Kit]] on any armor will transform it into the [[rpd:berserker_armor|Berserker Armor]], which is specifically designed for this subclass. This armor provides special abilities that synergize with the Berserker's combat style.

==== Advantages ====
  * Massive damage increase when health is low (2x attack damage)
  * Can turn near-death situations into offensive opportunities
  * Very effective at finishing fights when low on health
  * Self-sustaining combat potential when in Fury state

==== Disadvantages ====
  * Only activates when severely wounded
  * Requires taking damage to reach the berserker state
  * May encourage reckless play to trigger the ability
  * Vulnerable when health is high (no Fury buff)

==== Strategy ====
  * Leverage the damage boost by managing health carefully
  * Try to keep health low (but not too low) to maintain the Fury buff
  * Be aware of the 40% health threshold for the Fury effect
  * Consider defensive items that allow you to take hits while maximizing Fury uptime
  * Use the increased damage to quickly eliminate threats while in Fury state
  * Balance risk and reward to optimize the subclass benefits

==== Note about Page Naming ====
This page follows the current wiki convention for hero subclass pages using the `_subclass` suffix. If you arrived here from an old link, please note that hero subclass pages now use the format `subclass_name_subclass.txt` (e.g., `gladiator_subclass.txt`, `berserker_subclass.txt`) instead of just `subclass_name.txt`.
