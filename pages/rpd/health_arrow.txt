{{ rpd:images:item_HealthArrow.png|Health Arrow }}

**Health Arrow** is a special ranged ammunition item in Remixed Pixel Dungeon that heals allies or the hero on hit.

==== Description ====
A wooden arrow with a head soaked in healing material. When this arrow hits an ally or hero, it applies a healing effect that restores health. This is created by "moistening" a Common Arrow with a Potion of Healing.

==== Stats ====
  * **Damage:** 0 points (non-damaging)
  * **Delay:** 1.0x (relative to weapon firing speed)
  * **Durability:** Single use (consumed on impact)
  * **Price:** Cannot be purchased in shops; only created through moistening
  * **Weight:** 1

==== Properties ====
  * **Type:** Throwing/Ammunition (Special/Healing)
  * **Usage:** For use with ranged weapons like bows
  * **Consumable:** Each arrow is consumed after being shot
  * **Stackable:** Can stack up to very high quantities
  * **Special Effect:** Heals the target on hit, restoring health points

==== Creation ====
Health Arrows can be created by using a [[rpd:potion_of_healing|Potion of Healing]] on regular [[rpd:common_arrow|Common Arrows]]. This process is called "moistening" and transforms the basic arrow into one with special properties.

==== Mechanics ====
  * When hitting an ally or hero, restores 10-15 HP (may vary with hero level)
  * Does not damage enemies but may pass through them to reach allies
  * Can be used to heal pets, summons, and friendly NPCs
  * Healing amount may scale with the hero's level or other factors
  * Does not stack with other status effects that require direct targeting

==== Availability ====
  * **Creation Only:** Cannot be found as random loot; must be created by moistening
  * **Required Materials:** Common Arrow + Potion of Healing
  * **Alchemy:** Part of the game's alchemy system for creating special ammunition

==== Strategy ====
  * Excellent for healing allies or pets from a safe distance
  * Useful for keeping companion mobs healthy during difficult fights
  * Allows healing without using up direct-use healing potions
  * Good for maintaining party health during extended combat
  * Particularly valuable when fighting dangerous enemies that make close healing risky
