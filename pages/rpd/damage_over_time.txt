{{ rpd:images:burning_buff.png|Damage Over Time}}

Damage over time (DoT) refers to effects that cause damage periodically for a set number of turns, without requiring an active action from the source of the damage.

==== Types of Damage Over Time Effects ====
  * **[[rpd:burning_buff|Burning]]** - Fire damage that also destroys items
  * **[[rpd:poison_buff|Poison]]** - Damage based on percentage of current HP
  * **[[rpd:bleeding_buff|Bleeding]]** - Fixed damage per turn
  * **[[rpd:corruption|Corruption]]** - Gradually turns the target into an enemy
  * **[[rpd:drowsy_buff|Drowsy]]** - Eventually causes sleep effect

==== Sources of Damage Over Time ====
  * **Attacks**: Some enemies have attacks that apply DoT effects
  * **Traps**: Fire traps, poison traps, and other environmental hazards
  * **Weapons**: Weapons with specific enchantments (like Fire, Poison, etc.)
  * **Spells**: Certain spells like Ignite or Corrupt
  * **Items**: Some items may apply DoT when equipped or used

==== Countering Damage Over Time ====
  * **[[rpd:potion_of_purity_item|Potion of Purity]]** - Removes most DoT effects
  * **[[rpd:chalice_of_blood_item|Chalice of Blood]]** - For bleeding effects
  * **[[rpd:ring_of_elements|Ring of Elements]]** - Provides resistance to various DoT effects
  * **[[rpd:resistance_buff|Resistances]]** - Natural resistances can reduce or prevent DoT effects

==== Strategic Uses ====
  * Apply DoT to enemies before other attacks to increase overall damage
  * Combine DoT with other effects (like roots) to maximize damage while the enemy can't escape
  * Use DoT on groups of enemies to affect multiple targets simultaneously
  * Consider DoT when deciding whether to engage in combat
