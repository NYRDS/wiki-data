{{ rpd:images:sacrificial_sword_swords.png|Sacrificial Sword }}

==== Description ====
At first glance this aged bronze sword, covered with patina stains, looks absolutely useless. But some sort of old, archaic powers sleeps inside. Those powers can turn almost any creature to will-less slave. Just need find a right way to wake them...

==== Basic Stats ====
  * **Damage:** 2 (base damage)
  * **Speed:** 1.0x (normal attack speed)
  * **Accuracy:** 1.0x (normal accuracy)
  * **Durability:** Normal weapon durability
  * **Enchantment:** Cannot be enchanted
  * **Sprite:** Swords sprite sheet, image index 4

==== Special Properties ====
When attacking an enemy with the Sacrificial Sword, there is a chance to convert the enemy into a pet that fights for the player:

  * **Conversion Chance Formula:**
    * Base chance = (0.25 + (hero level × 4 + sword level²) × 0.01) × class bonus / armorPenalty
    * Armor Penalty = target armor's DR / 8
    * Class Bonuses: Necromancer (×3.0), Shaman (×2.0), Warden (×1.5), others (×1.0)
    * Additional modifiers: - (enemy defense skill × 0.01 × enemy speed) - (enemy HP × 0.01)

==== Restrictions ====
  * Cannot convert bosses
  * Cannot convert NPCs
  * Only works on mobs
  * Lower chance with higher enemy defense skill and speed
  * Lower chance against enemies with higher HP

==== Strategy ====
  * Wear no armor or light armor to maximize conversion chances (armor DR reduces success rate)
  * Hero subclasses like Shaman or Necromancer have significantly higher conversion rates
  * Try to weaken enemies before attempting to convert them (lower HP increases chances)
  * Avoid using against fast enemies with high defense
