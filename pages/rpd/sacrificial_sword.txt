The Sacrificial Sword is the most complicated artifact to find in RPD so far.

When hitting an enemy with it, there is a chance for the enemy to become your eternal slave. 
This chance is calculated randomly, but there are some modifiers.

The chances are greater when:
  * the level of the Sacrificial Sword is high
  * the level of the hero is high
  * the enemy has low hp
  * the enemy is slowed

Also wearing an armor drastically reduces chances to successful dominate the victim, and the hero subclass also influences the outcome. (Naked Shaman or Warden have far greater chance than Armored Warrior )
