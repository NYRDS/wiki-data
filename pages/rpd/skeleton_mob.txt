====== Skeleton Mob ======

{{ skeleton_mob.png|Skeleton }}

The **Skeleton** is a common undead enemy found throughout the dungeon, typically in the Prison and later levels.

==== Overview ====
Skeletons are reanimated bones of dead adventurers and denizens of the dungeon. They are persistent enemies that will relentlessly pursue the player character. Skeletons are immune to various status effects due to their undead nature.

==== Stats ====
  * **HP**: 25 (HT: 25)
  * **Defense Skill**: 9
  * **Attack Skill**: 12
  * **Damage**: 3-8
  * **Armor**: 5 DR (Defense Rating)
  * **EXP for Kill**: 5
  * **Maximum Level**: 10
  * **Undead**: Yes (immune to certain status effects)

==== Abilities ====
  * **Weapon Drop**: When defeated (outside Necro levels), has a 20% chance to drop a low-level weapon from the Treasury
  * **Undead Resistance**: Immune to fear, charm, and sleep effects
  * **Poison Immunity**: Immune to poison damage and status effects
  * **Corpse Explosion**: When killed, explodes dealing damage to nearby entities in a 5-cell radius
  * **Sound Effect**: Plays a bone-cracking sound when defeated (Assets.SND_BONES)

==== Combat Tactics ====
Skeletons are aggressive melee enemies that will pursue the player relentlessly. They cannot be charmed or frightened, making them consistently dangerous throughout the dungeon. Their bony structure provides some physical damage resistance.

==== Occurrence ====
  * **Primary Location**: Found throughout the Prison level and deeper dungeon levels
  * **Spawn Frequency**: Common in later dungeon levels (specifically levels 6-9 according to Bestiary.json)
  * **Group Behavior**: Usually found alone or in small groups
  * **Necro Level Exception**: In NecroBossLevel, they do not drop weapons

==== Strategy ====
  * Use ranged weapons or spells to attack from a distance
  * Avoid letting them corner you in narrow passages
  * Be careful with fire-based attacks as they cause explosion (though this is not explicitly stated as fire vulnerability)
  * They're resistant to many status effects, requiring direct damage
  * Try to avoid being surrounded as they explode on death, potentially harming you

==== Special Notes ====
  * Skeletons are undead, which affects how certain items and spells interact with them
  * They're immune to various effects that work on living creatures
  * Defeating them contributes to the "Skeleton Slayed" badge
  * They explode when killed, which can be dangerous to the player if standing too close
  * In NecroBossLevel, they don't drop weapons, as this level has different rules
