====== Skeleton Mob ======

{{ rpd:images:skeleton_mob.png|Skeleton }}

The **Skeleton** is a common [[rpd:undead_mob|undead]] enemy found throughout the dungeon, typically in the [[rpd:prison_level|Prison]] and later levels. A small chance of appearing in the [[rpd:sewers|Sewers]] as well.

==== Overview ====
Skeletons are reanimated bones of dead [[rpd:hero|adventurers]] and denizens of the dungeon. They are persistent enemies that will relentlessly pursue the player character. Skeletons are immune to various [[rpd:status_effects|status effects]] due to their [[rpd:undead_mob|undead]] nature.

==== Stats ====
  * **HP**: 25 (HT: 25)
  * **Defense Skill**: 9
  * **Attack Skill**: 12
  * **Damage**: 3-8 (see [[rpd:melee_combat|melee combat]] mechanics)
  * **Armor**: 5 DR (Defense Rating)
  * **EXP for Kill**: 5
  * **Maximum Level**: 10
  * **Undead**: Yes (immune to certain [[rpd:status_effects|status effects]])

==== Abilities ====
  * **Weapon Drop**: When defeated (outside [[rpd:necropolis_level|Necro levels]]), has a 20% chance to drop a random [[rpd:melee_weapon|melee weapon]], rarely upgraded.
  * **Undead Resistance**: Immune to [[rpd:fear|fear]], [[rpd:charm_spell|charm]], and [[rpd:sleep_buff|sleep]] effects
  * **Poison Immunity**: Immune to [[rpd:poison_buff|poison]] damage and status effects
  * **Corpse Explosion**: When killed, explodes dealing damage to nearby entities in 4 adjacent cells (horizontal and vertical directions, but not diagonal). The explosion damage is calculated as (skeleton's damage roll - target's [[rpd:defense|defense]] roll / 2). Never forget about this! Bone damage amounts to 3-8 (armor reduces the average value). Be especially careful when surrounded as they explode on death, potentially harming you.
  * **Sound Effect**: Plays a bone-cracking sound when defeated (Assets.SND_BONES)

==== Combat Tactics ====
Skeletons are aggressive [[rpd:melee_combat|melee]] enemies that will pursue the player relentlessly. They cannot be charmed or frightened, making them consistently dangerous throughout the dungeon. Their bony structure provides some physical damage resistance.

==== Occurrence ====
  * **Primary Location**: Found throughout the [[rpd:prison_level|Prison level]] (especially levels 7 and 8) and deeper dungeon levels
  * **Spawn Frequency**: Common in later dungeon levels (specifically levels 6-9 according to Bestiary.json)
  * **Secondary Location**: Small chance to appear in the [[rpd:sewers|Sewers]]
  * **Group Behavior**: Usually found alone or in small groups
  * **[[rpd:necropolis_level|Necro Level]] Exception**: In [[rpd:necropolis_level|NecroBossLevel]], they do not drop weapons

==== Strategy ====
  * Use [[rpd:ranged_weapons|ranged weapons]] or [[rpd:spells|spells]] to attack from a distance
  * Avoid letting them corner you in narrow passages
  * Be careful with fire-based attacks as they cause explosion (though this is not explicitly stated as fire vulnerability)
  * They're resistant to many [[rpd:status_effects|status effects]], requiring direct damage
  * Try to avoid being surrounded as they explode on death, potentially harming you

==== Special Notes ====
  * Skeletons are [[rpd:undead_mob|undead]], which affects how certain items and spells interact with them
  * They're immune to various effects that work on living creatures
  * Defeating them contributes to the "Skeleton Slayed" [[rpd:badges|badge]]
  * They explode when killed, which can be dangerous to the player if standing too close
  * In [[rpd:necropolis_level|NecroBossLevel]], they don't drop weapons, as this level has different rules
