====== Terror ======

Terror is a status effect in Remixed Dungeon that forces the affected character to flee in fear from their opponent.

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Effect:** Affected characters run away from their target
  * **Duration:** 10 turns by default (Terror.DURATION constant)
  * **Action:** Characters can still act (use items, attack if cornered) while fleeing
  * **Movement:** Prioritizes movement away from the source of terror
  * **Immunities:** Some creatures have immunity to terror (Undead, Statues, DM-300, Golems, Monks, Brutes, IceGuardian, IceGuardianCore, Yog's organs, Burning Fist, Rotting Fist, Runic Skull, Lich, etc.)
  * **Recovery:** Terror can be recovered from if the cooldown is less than DURATION

==== Sources of Terror ====
  * [[rpd:scroll_of_terror|Scroll of Terror]] - Can be used offensively or defensively
  * [[rpd:horror_enchantment|Horror enchantment]] - Weapons with this enchantment can cause terror on hit

  * Some enemies like [[rpd:rat|Rats]] may cause terror when damaged
  * Some Yog organs like [[rpd:yogsheart|Yog's Heart]], [[rpd:yogsbrain|Yog's Brain]], and others are immune to terror

==== Strategy ====
  * **For Players:** Use terror to separate enemies from groups or dangerous positions
  * **Defensively:** Can be used to escape dangerous situations temporarily
  * **Combat:** Terror can break up enemy formations
  * **Movement:** When affected, look for safe areas to be cornered if necessary

==== Countering Terror ====

  * Use terrain to your advantage (move toward safe areas)
