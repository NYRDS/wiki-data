====== Terror ======

Terror is a status effect in Remixed Dungeon that forces the affected character to flee in fear from their opponent.

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Effect:** Affected characters run away from their target
  * **Duration:** Lasts for a limited number of turns
  * **Action:** Characters can still act (use items, attack if cornered) while fleeing
  * **Movement:** Prioritizes movement away from the source of terror

==== Sources of Terror ====
  * [[rpd:scroll_of_terror|Scroll of Terror]] - Can be used offensively or defensively
  * [[rpd:wand_of_fear|Wand of Fear]] - Inflicts terror on hit
  * [[rpd:monk|Monk]] - Can cause terror as part of their abilities
  * Some enemies may have abilities that cause terror

==== Strategy ====
  * **For Players:** Use terror to separate enemies from groups or dangerous positions
  * **Defensively:** Can be used to escape dangerous situations temporarily
  * **Combat:** Terror can break up enemy formations
  * **Movement:** When affected, look for safe areas to be cornered if necessary

==== Countering Terror ====
  * Wait for the effect to naturally expire
  * Use terrain to your advantage (move toward safe areas)
  * Be prepared to fight if cornered
  * Use healing or similar items if movement is critical

==== Immunities ====
  * [[rpd:undead|Undead]] creatures are typically immune to terror
  * [[rpd:statues|Statues]] and mindless enemies may be immune
  * Some [[rpd:mindless|minless]] creatures might be immune
