{{ rpd:images:chaos_armor_item.png|Chaos Armor }}

==== Description ====
This armor consists of blood-red plates that are sewed together with dark red chains. They irradiate chaotic energy as you touch them.

==== Stats ====
  * **Type**: Armor
  * **Tier**: 3
  * **Default Image**: chaosArmor.png
  * **Upgrade Limitation**: Cannot be upgraded (isUpgradable() returns false)
  * **Special Mechanism**: Charge system increases when wearer deals damage, decreases when wearer takes damage

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Charge System**: 
    * Charge increases when wearer deals damage (if not cursed)
    * Charge decreases when wearer takes damage
    * When charge reaches threshold (based on armor level), the armor upgrades
    * When charge depletes to 0 on level 4+, the armor degrades and loses inscription
  * **Visual Changes**: Image changes based on armor level (0-4 images possible)
  * **Level Requirement**: Upgrades only when charge reaches ''(5 * level()^1.5)'' 

==== Strategy ====
  * Effective against enemies that take damage (charges armor)
  * Be careful during tough fights where you take damage (depletes charge)
  * At level 4+, losing all charge results in degradation and loss of inscription
  * Works best for aggressive playstyle where hero does more damage than taking
