====== Shadow Lord ======

{{ rpd:images:shadowlord_sprite.png|Shadow Lord Sprite }}

The Shadow Lord is a powerful boss creature made of pure evil and impenetrable darkness. Many believe that he is the Old God himself, considering how powerful he is. While others assume that he is but a guardian of the Old God's chambers. He appears in his own dedicated level - the Shadow Lord Level.
