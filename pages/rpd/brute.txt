  * **Group Tactics:** Often found with other gnolls
  * **Terror Immunity:** Immune to the Terror status effect
  * **Berserker Connection:** Connected to the Berserker subclass - the town priest may be persuaded to heal the Gnoll Brute to unlock the Warrior's Berserker subclass

==== Location ====
  * Found in the [[rpd:prison|Prison]] level (floors 6-9)
  * Part of the gnoll encampments in the Prison level

==== Strategy ====
  * Brutes are significantly stronger than regular gnolls with more HP and higher damage output
  * Their Terror immunity makes fear-based tactics ineffective
  * Be cautious when fighting Brutes at low health, as they will go berserk and deal increased damage
  * Due to their high defense skill, accuracy may be an issue with low-level weapons
  * The Berserker connection suggests a thematic link to the Warrior's Berserker subclass
