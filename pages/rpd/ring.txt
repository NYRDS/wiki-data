====== Ring ======

Rings are wearable items in Remixed Dungeon that provide continuous magical bonuses while equipped.

==== Description ====
Rings are accessories that provide ongoing magical effects while equipped. Each ring takes up one of the hero's accessory slots and provides a passive effect. Rings can be equipped on fingers, and the hero may wear one ring per hand (two total).

==== Mechanics ====
  * Rings must be identified to know their effect
  * Identified rings may be cursed, causing negative effects
  * Rings can be upgraded to improve their effects
  * Some rings provide stacking effects when worn in multiples
  * Some rings have opposing effects and shouldn't be worn simultaneously

==== Identification ====
Like other magical items, rings must be identified to determine their effect. This is typically done by wearing the ring and observing its effect. Cursed rings will be apparent immediately.

==== Strategy ====
  * Choose rings that complement your play style and needs
  * Be cautious when wearing unid rings as they might be cursed
  * Prioritize rings that enhance your class abilities
  * Consider the trade-offs of wearing multiple rings of different types
