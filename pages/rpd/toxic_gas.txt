====== Toxic Gas ======

**Toxic Gas** is a harmful gas effect that can occur from various sources in the dungeon. When characters enter areas filled with toxic gas, they take damage over time.

==== Mechanics ====
  * Fills a circular area of the dungeon
  * Causes damage each turn spent within the gas
  * Persists for a limited time before dissipating
  * Characters with poison resistance also resist toxic gas

==== Sources ====
  * **Toxic Trap**: Releases toxic gas in an area
  * **Venti Fan**: Can create areas of toxic gas
  * **Certain mobs**: Some enemies can create toxic gas
  * **Wands**: Some wands can create toxic gas clouds

==== Resistance ====
  * Some armor and rings provide resistance
  * Certain classes have higher natural resistance
  * The same resistances that work against poison also work against toxic gas
