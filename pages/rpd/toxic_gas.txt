====== Toxic Gas ======

Toxic Gas is a harmful environmental effect in Remixed Dungeon that damages creatures within its area.

==== Description ====
Toxic Gas is a greenish cloud of poisonous gas that spreads through the dungeon, causing damage to most living creatures that remain within it. It's typically created by throwing a [[rpd:potion_of_toxic_gas|Potion of Toxic Gas]].

==== Effects ====
  * **Damage Over Time:** Causes repeated damage while in the gas
  * **Damage Formula:** (character's HP + 5 + dungeon_depth * 5) / 40, with a chance for +1 damage
  * **Area of Effect:** Covers multiple adjacent cells
  * **Duration:** Persists for several turns before dissipating
  * **Heap Interaction:** Poisons items in heaps that are within the gas
  * **Counter-Interaction:** Toxic gas cancels out with [[rpd:paralytic_gas|Paralytic Gas]] when they occupy the same tile

==== Creation ====
  * [[rpd:potion_of_toxic_gas|Potion of Toxic Gas]] - Thrown potion creates a large gas cloud (1000 volume)
  * [[rpd:toxic_trap|Toxic Trap]] - Traps create gas clouds (300 + 20 * dungeon depth volume)
  * [[rpd:rotten_food|Rotten Food]] - Creates gas when thrown (500 volume)
  * Certain enemies like [[rpd:dm300|DM300]] and [[rpd:lich|Lich]] can produce toxic gas
  * [[rpd:glyph_of_stench|Glyph of Stench]] on armor can occasionally produce toxic gas when attacked
  * Some plants like [[rpd:sorrowmoss|Sorrowmoss]] can be transmuted into potions of toxic gas

==== Affected Creatures ====
  * Most living enemies and players
  * **Immune Creatures:** Statues, Mirror Images, Mimic Pies, Piranhas, DM300, various Yog's body parts, Suspicious Rats, Zombies, Crystal mobs, IceElemental, EarthElemental, IceGuardian, IceGuardianCore, Tengu, Goo, King, BurningFist, YogsTeeth, RottingFist, YogsBrain
  * **Resistant Creatures:** Some bosses like Tengu, Goo, King, YogsBrain, BurningFist, RottingFist, YogsTeeth

==== Strategy ====
  * **For Players:** Use to damage groups of enemies efficiently
  * **Defensive:** Avoid standing in toxic gas clouds to prevent damage
  * **Environmental:** Can block passages temporarily to control enemy movement
  * **Tactical:** Consider gas spread before throwing potions to maximize area coverage
  * **Note:** Toxic gas can be dangerous to yourself if you can't escape quickly

==== Countermeasures ====
  * Don't stand in the gas if avoidable
  * Equipment like [[rpd:ring_of_elements|Ring of Elements]] may provide resistance to gas effects
  * [[rpd:potion_of_purity|Potion of Purity]] can clear toxic gas from an area
  * Consider timing when the gas will clear before entering an area
  * Avoid using in enclosed spaces where gas will linger and potentially trap you
