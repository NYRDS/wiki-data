{{ rpd:images:hero_ROGUE.png|Rogue Class }}

The **Rogue** is one of the starting playable classes in Remixed Dungeon. He is a master of stealth and cunning, specializing in stealth, detection, and agility. Known for high evasion and detection capabilities.

==== Class Overview ====
  * **Primary Focus**: Stealth and agility
  * **Special Ability**: Enhanced detection and high evasion
  * **Playstyle**: Evasive combat with detection advantages
  * **Magic Affinity**: [[rpd:rogue_affinity|Rogue]]

==== Starting Stats and Equipment ====
  * **Starting HP**: 20
  * **Starting STR**: 10
  * **Starting Equipment**:
    * +1 [[rpd:ring_of_shadows_item|Ring of Shadows]] (identified)
    * [[rpd:cloth_armor_item|Cloth Armor]] (identified)
    * [[rpd:gold_item|100 Gold]]
    * [[rpd:cloak_spell|Cloak spell]] (in quickslot)
    * [[rpd:scroll_of_magic_mapping_item|Scroll of Magic Mapping]] (known item)

==== Class Perks ====
  * **Ring of Shadows +1**: Starts with a [[rpd:ring_of_shadows_item|Ring of Shadows]] +1 (from ''initHeroes.json'', ROGUE section)
  * **Ring Identification**: Identifies the type of a ring on equipping it (from ''Ring.java:180'' where ''getHeroClass() == HeroClass.ROGUE'')
  * **Light Armor Proficiency**: Proficient with light armor, dodging better while wearing it (from ''HeroClass_RogPerks_2'' in string resources)
  * **Detection Expertise**: Proficient in detecting hidden doors and traps (from ''HeroClass_RogPerks_3'' in string resources)
  * **Slow Hunger**: Can go without food longer (from ''HeroClass_RogPerks_4'' in string resources)
  * **Identified Maps**: Scrolls of Magic Mapping are identified from the beginning (from ''HeroClass_RogPerks_5'' in string resources)

==== Class Abilities ====
  * **High Evasion**: Higher chance to dodge enemy attacks (from ''HeroClass_RogPerks_2'' in string resources)
  * **Detection**: Better at finding hidden doors and traps (from ''HeroClass_RogPerks_3'' in string resources)
  * **Deception**: Special [[rpd:rogue_armor_item|class armor]] ability for invisibility (from ''RogueArmor.java'' - "smoke bomb" ability)

==== Advantages ====
  * High evasion makes difficult to hit
  * Better at detecting traps and secret doors
  * Fast weapons for more frequent attacks
  * Special abilities for stealth and escape
  * Good for players who prefer strategic positioning
  * [[rpd:ring_of_shadows_item|Ring of Shadows]] is pre-identified and enhanced
  * Resists effects that slow down the hero (from ''Char.java:572'' where ''getHeroClass() == HeroClass.ROGUE'' - hunger step is 1.2x normal)

==== Disadvantages ====
  * Lower direct combat effectiveness than Warrior
  * [[rpd:ring_of_shadows_item|Ring of Shadows]] requires energy to be effective
  * Lower health than Warrior
  * More dependent on finding good equipment quickly

==== Subclasses ====
  * [[rpd:assassin_subclass|Assassin]]: When performing a surprise attack, inflicts additional damage to the target
  * [[rpd:freerunner_subclass|Free Runner]]: Can move almost twice as fast as most monsters; when running, is much harder to hit (requires being unencumbered and not starving)

==== Class Armor ====
Rogues have access to [[rpd:rogue_armor_item|Rogue Armor]] (obtained by using the [[rpd:armor_kit_item|Armor Kit]] on any regular armor) that grants temporary invisibility, allowing for escape or strategic positioning.

==== Strategy ====
  * Use high evasion to avoid taking damage
  * Rely on detection to navigate safely
  * Use fast weapons frequently for potential combo attacks
  * Take advantage of stealth abilities when needed
  * Look for opportunities to backstab or gain advantage
  * Consider mastery path based on playstyle preferences
