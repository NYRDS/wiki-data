{{ rpd:images:item_ArmorKit.png|Armor Kit }}

An **Armor Kit** is a special item in Remixed Dungeon that allows players to upgrade regular armor into class-specific armor for their hero subclass.

==== Item Overview ====
  * **Type:** Crafting/Upgrade Item
  * **Acquisition:** Dropped by [[rpd:the_king|King]] boss in the Halls level (as defined in [[code:RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/nyrds/pixeldungeon/mobs/npc/ArmorSmith.java#L42-L44|ArmorSmith.java:42-44]])
  * **Purpose:** Transform regular armor into class-specific armor
  * **Usage:** Must be used on regular armor while playing as a hero who has chosen the appropriate subclass

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Conversion:** Transforms any regular armor into the corresponding class armor
  * **Stats Preservation:** The upgraded armor retains all properties of the original armor (defense value, enchantment, level)
  * **Subclass Specific:** Each class armor can only be equipped by the corresponding subclass
  * **One-time Use:** The armor kit is consumed when used

==== Class Armors Created ====
  * **Warrior:** [[rpd:warrior_armor|Warrior Armor]] (with Leap ability) - requires Gladiator subclass
  * **Mage:** [[rpd:mage_armor|Mage Armor]] (with Mage Staff special) - requires Battlemage subclass
  * **Rogue:** [[rpd:rogue_armor|Rogue Armor]] (with Smoke Bomb ability) - requires Freerunner subclass
  * **Huntress:** [[rpd:huntress_armor|Huntress Armor]] (with Spirit Hawk ability) - requires Warden subclass
  * **Assassin:** [[rpd:assassin_armor|Assassin Armor]] (with Shadow Step ability) - requires Assassin subclass
  * **Necromancer:** [[rpd:necromancer_armor|Necromancer Robe]] (with Raise Dead ability) - requires Warlock subclass
  * **Gnoll:** [[rpd:gnoll_armor|Gnoll Armor]] (with Pack Hunt ability) - requires Guardian subclass or Witch Doctor subclass

==== Strategy ====
  * Essential for maximizing subclass effectiveness
  * Should be crafted as soon as possible after choosing a subclass
  * Allows full utilization of subclass abilities
  * Preserve high-level armor before upgrading to maintain benefits
