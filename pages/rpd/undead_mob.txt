====== Undead ======

**Undead** is a mob in Remixed Dungeon summoned by the King boss. These are reanimated warriors that serve the King in the final dungeon levels.

  * **Defense Skill:** 15
  * **Attack Skill:** 16
  * **Damage:** 12-16
  * **Armor Class:** 5
  * **EXP for Kill:** 0
  * **Undead Status:** Yes (immune to status effects targeting living creatures)

==== Description ====
The Undead are reanimated warriors that serve the King. They are summoned by the King during combat and fight alongside him. They are former members of the King's army, brought back through dark magic.

==== Behavior ====
  * **Summoned:** Created by the King during combat when he needs additional forces
  * **Attack:** Has a chance to stun targets on hit (1 in MAX_ARMY_SIZE chance)
  * **Toxic Gas Interaction:** When damaged by toxic gas, the gas blob is cleared
  * **Death Sound:** Plays a bone-cracking death sound when killed

==== Strategy ====
  * The King will summon Undead when his army size is below maximum
  * They are not particularly dangerous individually but can overwhelm if many are summoned
  * Focus on the King to prevent more from being summoned
  * Consider using AoE attacks when multiple Undead are present
  * Be aware that [[rpd:heal_spell|Heal]] spells will not work on them

==== Interactions ====
  * **Immunities:** Immune to [[rpd:poison_buff|Poison]] and [[rpd:bleeding_buff|Bleeding]]
  * **Vulnerabilities:** Vulnerable to holy/light-based attacks and healing magic (which damages them)
  * **Status Effects:** Immune to status effects that target living creatures (sleep, paralysis, charm)
