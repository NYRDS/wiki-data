====== Belongings ======

The **Belongings** system manages the hero's inventory and equipment in Remixed Dungeon. It handles what items the hero can carry and wear.

==== Inventory Slots ====
The hero has a limited number of slots to carry items:

  * **Inventory**: 19 slots for general items (food, potions, scrolls, etc.)
  * **[[rpd:quickslots|Quickslots]]**: 4 slots for frequently used items (accessed with number keys)

==== Equipment Slots ====
The hero can equip specific types of items in dedicated slots:

  * **[[rpd:weapon_item|Weapon]]**: Main hand for attacking
  * **[[rpd:armor_item|Armor]]**: Body slot for protection
  * **[[rpd:ring|Ring 1]]**: First finger
  * **[[rpd:ring|Ring 2]]**: Second finger
  * **[[rpd:artifacts|Artifact]]**: Special slot for artifacts (class-dependent)

==== Item Mechanics ====
  * **[[rpd:weight|Weight]]**: Items have weight that affects movement speed if carrying too much
  * **[[rpd:stacking|Stacking]]**: Identical items stack in inventory (like throwing weapons, potions, etc.)
  * **[[rpd:identification_system|Identification]]**: Uncursed items need to be identified to know their properties
  * **[[rpd:curse|Curses]]**: Some equipment comes cursed and cannot be removed until blessed
