====== Customizations ======

In recent updates, Challenges have evolved into **Customizations** which now include both restrictions (the original challenges) and facilitations (new helpful modifiers), allowing for greater gameplay variety.

Customizations are accessed after obtaining the Amulet of Yendor and can modify various aspects of gameplay to increase difficulty, provide assistance, or create unique gameplay scenarios.

===== Restrictions (Former Challenges) =====

These customizations make the game more difficult by restricting resources or abilities:

  * **[[rpd:challenges#no_food|No Food]]** - No food items appear in the dungeon except for the starting ration
  * **[[rpd:challenges#no_armor|No Armor]]** - No armor items appear in the dungeon except for the starting cloth armor
  * **[[rpd:challenges#no_healing|No Healing]]** - No healing potions appear in the dungeon
  * **[[rpd:challenges#no_herbalism|No Herbalism]]** - No seeds, dew drops, or dew vials appear in the dungeon
  * **[[rpd:challenges#swarm_intelligence|Swarm Intelligence]]** - Once a monster notices you, all others become informed about your location too
  * **[[rpd:challenges#darkness|Into the Darkness]]** - The dungeon remains dark as Demon Halls
  * **[[rpd:challenges#no_scrolls|No Scrolls]]** - No scrolls appear in the dungeon, except for Scroll of Upgrade
  * **[[rpd:challenges#no_weapon|No Weapon]]** - No weapons, wands, or throwable items appear in the dungeon
  * **[[rpd:challenges#no_town|No Town]]** - Town portal spells are forbidden
  * **[[rpd:challenges#no_map|No Map]]** - The dungeon map is not revealed by walking around

===== Facilitations =====

These customizations provide assistance or helpful modifications to gameplay:

  * **[[rpd:facilitations#no_hunger|No Hunger]]** - Hero doesn't get hungry, preventing hunger damage
  * **[[rpd:facilitations#fast_regeneration|Fast Regeneration]]** - Faster health regeneration rate
  * **[[rpd:facilitations#fast_mana_regeneration|Fast Mana Regeneration]]** - Faster mana regeneration rate
  * **[[rpd:facilitations#super_strength|Super Strength]]** - Enhanced strength or carrying capacity
