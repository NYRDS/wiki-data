====== Customizations ======

In recent updates, Challenges have evolved into **Customizations** which now include both restrictions (the original challenges) and facilitations (new helpful modifiers), allowing for greater gameplay variety.

Customizations are accessed after obtaining the Amulet of Yendor and can modify various aspects of gameplay to increase difficulty, provide assistance, or create unique gameplay scenarios.

===== Restrictions (Former Challenges) =====

These customizations make the game more difficult by restricting resources or abilities:

  * Faith is my armor - there wouldn't be any armor in the game, except for your cloth armor. Any armor, appeared on the level will be transformed into the amount of gold equal to its cost in the shop. But you still can get armor when you complete the Sad Ghost's quest.
  * Dry land - there won't be any seeds and dew in the game.
  * On the diet - there won't be any food, except for your starting food ration. will be transformed into the amount of gold equal to its cost in the shop.
  * Into the darkness - the dungeon will be dark as Demon Halls.
  * Collective mind - Once a monster notices you, all others become informed about your location too.
  * Pharmacophobia - there won't be any health potions at all. Any health potion, appeared on the level will be transformed into the amount of gold equal to its cost in the shop (30 gold).
  * Forbidden runes - there wouldn't be any scrolls, except for Scroll of Upgrade. Any other scroll, appeared on the level will be transformed into the amount of gold equal to its cost in the shop.

===== Facilitations =====

These customizations provide assistance or helpful modifications to gameplay:

  * Pacifism - A new challenge mentioned in changelogs where players might have different objectives than combat
  * Additional modifiers that may provide benefits to players seeking a different type of gameplay experience

===== Strategy =====

Customizations allow players to tailor the dungeon experience to their preferred level of difficulty or to create unique challenges. Players can choose to make the game more difficult with restrictions or experiment with facilitations for different gameplay styles.
