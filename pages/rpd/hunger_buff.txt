====== Hunger Buff ======

{{ rpd:images:buff_Hunger.png|Hunger }}

The **Hunger** buff is a status effect that gradually increases the player's hunger level over time, leading to negative effects if not managed properly.

==== Description ====
Hunger is a status effect that accumulates over time. As the hunger level increases, the hero's health gradually decreases. If the hunger level reaches the "Starving" threshold, the hero will start taking damage each turn.

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Hunger Thresholds:**
    * **Normal**: No penalties
    * **Hungry**: 280 units (defined as Hunger.HUNGRY constant)
    * **Starving**: 400 units (defined as Hunger.STARVING constant)
  * **Damage:** When starving, the hero takes damage equal to max(1, effectiveSTR() - 10) in higher difficulties (difficulty ≥ 3)
  * **Recovery:** Eating food items reduces the hunger level by the food's energy value
  * **Special Effects:** In difficulty 3+, starving also has chances to apply Weakness or Vertigo
  * **Step Rate:** The rate of hunger accumulation varies based on character class (Rogues accumulate faster) and whether in safe areas (dungeons only)
  * **Rings:** Ring of Satiety reduces the rate of hunger accumulation

==== Food Values ====
  * **Ration**: Provides 280 energy units (Hunger.HUNGRY value)
  * **Overpriced Ration**: Provides 140 energy units (Hunger.STARVING - Hunger.HUNGRY)
  * **Rotten Ration**: Provides 60 energy units (calculated as (HUNGRY - STARVING)/2)
  * **Frozen Carpaccio**: Provides 60 energy units (Hunger.STARVING - Hunger.HUNGRY)
  * **Mystery Meat**: Provides 60 energy units (Hunger.STARVING - Hunger.HUNGRY)
  * **Chargrilled Meat**: Provides 60 energy units (Hunger.STARVING - Hunger.HUNGRY)
  * **Pasty**: Provides 400 energy units (Hunger.STARVING value)
  * **Pumpkin Pie**: Provides 400 energy units (Hunger.STARVING value)
  * **Christmas Turkey**: Provides 400 energy units (Hunger.STARVING value)

==== Strategic Considerations ====
  * Higher difficulties accelerate the hunger rate and cause more significant damage when starving
  * Carrying multiple food items is essential for survival in deep dungeon runs
  * Food can be preserved by storing it in special containers to prevent spoilage
  * Using a Ring of Satiety will slow down hunger accumulation
  * Safe areas (shops, etc.) stop hunger accumulation
