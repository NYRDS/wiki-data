====== Hero Subclasses ======

**Hero Subclasses** (also known as Masteries) are advanced specializations that become available when a hero reaches level 10 and reads a [[rpd:tome_of_mastery|Tome of Mastery]]. Each hero class has two unique subclasses that further define the character's abilities and playstyle.
