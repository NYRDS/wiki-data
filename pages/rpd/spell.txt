====== Spell ======

Spells in Remixed Pixel Dungeon are special abilities that can be cast by certain classes or obtained through various means. Unlike scrolls, spells are typically reusable abilities that don't consume inventory space once learned.

==== Types of Spells ====
There are several categories of spells in the game:

  * [[rpd:spell_affinities|Spell Affinities]] - Spells are organized by magical affinities such as Elemental, Combat, Rogue, Huntress, etc.
  * [[rpd:common_spell|Common Spells]] - Basic spells available to most classes
  * Class-specific spells - Advanced spells tied to particular class affinities

==== Obtaining Spells ====
Spells can be obtained in various ways:
  * Some classes start with specific spells (e.g. Mage starts with [[rpd:wind_gust_spell|Wind Gust]])
  * Found as items in the dungeon
  * Learned through special items or interactions
  * Crafted using modding capabilities

==== Spell Mechanics ====
  * Spells generally have a mana cost that must be paid to cast them
  * Each spell has a casting time which affects how quickly it can be used
  * Some spells have targeting requirements (self, enemy, location, etc.)
  * The effectiveness of spells often scales with the character's relevant skill level
