====== Guardian Armor ======

{{ rpd:images:guardian_armor_sprite.png|Guardian Armor }}

Guardian Armor is the class-specific armor obtained by using an [[rpd:armor_kit|Armor Kit]] on any regular armor for the [[rpd:guardian|Guardian]] subclass in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Acquisition ====
  * Use an [[rpd:armor_kit|Armor Kit]] on any regular armor while playing as a [[rpd:gnoll|Gnoll]] who has chosen the [[rpd:guardian|Guardian]] subclass
  * Transforms the base armor into Guardian Armor with special properties using the ClassArmor upgrade mechanism

==== Special Properties ====
  * Inherits all properties of [[rpd:gnoll_armor|Gnoll Armor]]
  * Special ability: ''Domination'' - Charm nearby mobs for a short duration
  * Requires sufficient skill points to use special ability (cost is 1/3 of max skill points rounded up)
  * Exclusive to the [[rpd:guardian|Guardian]] subclass - cannot be equipped if not the Guardian subclass
  * Is a type of [[rpd:class_armor|Class Armor]]

==== Stats ====
  * **Durability**: Full durability of original armor
  * **Defense**: Same DR (Defense Rating) as original armor
  * **Strength Requirement**: Same STR requirement as original armor
  * **Enchantments**: Preserves original armor's glyph
  * **Special Ability**: ''Domination'' allows charming nearby mobs for a short duration

==== Behavior ====
  * When activated (''Domination'' special ability), it attempts to charm all visible and adjacent mobs within the field of view
  * The number of mobs that can be charmed is limited by skill points (the higher your level, the more mobs can be charmed)
  * Charming effect works only on mobs that can be pets

==== Usage ====
  * Essential armor for maximizing the effectiveness of the [[rpd:guardian|Guardian]] subclass
  * Should be crafted as soon as possible after choosing the [[rpd:guardian|Guardian]] subclass
  * Allows full utilization of subclass abilities
  * Provides significant tactical advantage through its ''Domination'' ability

==== Technical Information ====
  * **Java Class**: [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/watabou/pixeldungeon/items/armor/GuardianArmor.java|GuardianArmor.java]]
  * **Inherits From**: [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/watabou/pixeldungeon/items/armor/GnollArmor.java|GnollArmor.java]]
  * **Base Class**: [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/watabou/pixeldungeon/items/armor/ClassArmor.java|ClassArmor.java]]

==== Notes ====
  * Part of the subclass identity system in Remixed Dungeon
  * Class armors represent the unique nature of each subclass
  * Cannot be worn by characters who haven't unlocked the appropriate subclass
  * Inherits the base [[rpd:gnoll_armor|Gnoll armor]] properties and special ability
  * Obtained via the [[rpd:armor_kit|Armor Kit]] transformation process, not starting equipment
  * [[rpd:armor_kit|Armor Kit]] is obtained by defeating King boss in City level
