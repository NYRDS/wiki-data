====== Guardian Armor ======

{{ rpd:images:guardian_armor.png|Guardian Armor }}

The **Guardian Armor** is the class-specific armor for the [[rpd:gnoll_class|Gnoll]] class, particularly associated with the Guardian subclass. Though the code indicates it was intended for the Guardian subclass, currently only the Gnoll class can equip it.

==== Item Overview ====
  * **Type:** Class Armor
  * **Class:** [[rpd:gnoll_class|Gnoll]]
  * **Subclass:** [[rpd:guardian_subclass|Guardian]]
  * **Special Effect:** Unique abilities related to protection and defensive mechanics

==== Special Abilities ====
  * **Defensive Mechanics:** The armor provides special abilities related to protection and defensive mechanics
  * **Shield Synergy:** Provides bonuses when using shields
  * **Class-specific:** Only usable by the Gnoll class (though the code indicates it should be for the Guardian subclass)

==== Obtaining ====
  * Available as a class armor for the Gnoll class via the [[rpd:tengu_liver_item|Tengu Liver]] which allows choosing between [[rpd:guardian_subclass|Guardian]] and [[rpd:witchdoctor_subclass|Witch Doctor]] subclasses
  * Can be crafted using an [[rpd:armor_kit_item|Armor Kit]] on regular armor of the same tier

==== Strategy ====
  * Enhances defensive playstyles
  * Synergizes with shield-based combat approaches
  * Note: The current implementation in code only allows Gnoll class to equip it, though the intended functionality is for the Guardian subclass

==== Content Verification ====
  * Information source: Java Class [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/watabou/pixeldungeon/items/armor/GuardianArmor.java|GuardianArmor.java]]
  * Stats verification: Extracted from GuardianArmor.java class methods
  * Effect descriptions: Based on code analysis and class-specific mechanics
  * Note: The code has a commented out section that would check for the Guardian subclass instead of the Gnoll class
