{{ rpd:images:airelemental_sprite.png|Air Elemental Sprite }}

Air Elementals are flying magic beings made of living air. They appear in the Chasm feeling, and are immune to bleeding. They use the Wind Gust spell to attack enemies.

==== Properties ====
  * **HP**: Scales with depth (hp = depth * 3 + 1)
  * **Attack**: High (baseAttackSkill = baseDefenseSkill * 2 + 1)
  * **Defense**: Scales with depth (baseDefenseSkill = depth * 2 + 1)
  * **Damage**: 0 to ht() / 4 (increases with HP)
  * **EXP**: depth + 1
  * **Max Level**: depth + 2
  * **DR**: expForKill / 5
  * **Carcass Chance**: 0%
  * **Flying**: Yes (cannot be affected by ground-based effects)
  * **Immunities**: [[rpd:bleeding|Bleeding]]
  * **Special Ability**: Uses Wind Gust spell when attacking
  * **Loot**: [[rpd:potion_of_levitation|Potion of Levitation]] (10% chance)

==== Behavior ====
  * Air Elementals have a unique movement pattern - when they get too close to the target (distance < skillLevel - 1), they move away instead of approaching
  * They can attack from a distance (up to skillLevel range) but won't attack adjacent enemies
  * When they attack, they cast Wind Gust which creates wind particles and burst effects on the target
  * They only appear in the Chasm feeling, which has a 20% chance to appear on dungeon levels

==== Strategy ====
  * Air Elementals cannot be trapped in pits or affected by ground-based obstacles
  * Their Wind Gust ability can push characters, potentially into dangerous positions
  * They are immune to effects that require physical contact or ground presence
  * They can be challenging to fight in narrow corridors due to push effects
  * They move erratically due to their unique movement pattern
