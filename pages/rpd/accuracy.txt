====== Accuracy ======

**Accuracy** is a derived combat stat in Remixed Dungeon that affects the chance to successfully hit enemies with attacks. It is primarily determined by the hero's Attack Skill statistic.

==== Mechanics ====
Accuracy in combat is calculated using the following formula:
  * **Hit Chance** = Attack Skill / (Attack Skill + Enemy Defense Skill)
  * Additional factors can modify this base chance

==== Factors Affecting Accuracy ====

=== Primary Stat ===
  * **Attack Skill**: The main component of accuracy
  * Increases with hero level and strength
  * Affected by equipment bonuses

=== Equipment Bonuses ===
  * **[[rpd:ring_of_accuracy|Ring of Accuracy]]**: Provides direct accuracy bonus
  * **[[rpd:weapon_enchantments|Weapon Enchantments]]**: Some enchantments affect accuracy
  * **Armor Properties**: Some armor types can affect attack speed and accuracy

=== Status Effects ===
  * **[[rpd:blindness_buff|Blindness]]**: Reduces accuracy significantly
  * **[[rpd:vertigo_buff|Vertigo]]**: Affects accuracy and movement
  * **Various Buffs/Debuffs**: Temporary effects that modify accuracy

==== Combat Impact ====
  * Higher accuracy increases the chance to land hits in combat
  * Reduces the effectiveness of enemy dodging
  * Particularly important for heroes with lower base Attack Skill
  * Essential for ranged combat effectiveness

==== Class Differences ====
  * Different hero classes have varying base Attack Skill progression
  * Some subclasses enhance accuracy in specific ways
  * Equipment synergies vary by class

==== Improving Accuracy ====
  * **Rings**: [[rpd:ring_of_accuracy|Ring of Accuracy]] provides the most direct improvement
  * **Leveling**: Attack Skill improves with hero level
  * **Strength**: Higher strength from [[rpd:ring_of_might|Ring of Might]] or potions can help
  * **Enchantments**: Certain weapon enchantments may provide accuracy bonuses
