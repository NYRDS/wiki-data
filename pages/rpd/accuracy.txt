====== Accuracy ======

Accuracy is a combat mechanic in Remixed Pixel Dungeon that determines the chance to successfully hit a target with attacks. Higher accuracy increases the probability of landing hits on enemies.

==== Accuracy Statistics ====
  * **Attack Skill**: The primary factor determining hit probability
  * **Weapon Type**: Different weapons may have accuracy modifiers
  * **Distance**: Ranged attacks may have accuracy penalties at longer ranges

==== Factors Affecting Accuracy ====
  * **Strength**: Higher strength can improve accuracy with some weapons
  * **Weapon Enchantments**: Some enchantments affect accuracy
  * **Buff Effects**: Temporary accuracy boosts from various status effects
  * **Status Effects**: Negative effects like blindness can reduce accuracy

==== Accuracy Calculation ====
The game calculates hit probability by comparing the attacker's Attack Skill against the target's Defense Skill, with random factors determining if the attack connects.

==== Benefits of High Accuracy ====
  * **Consistent Damage**: Ensures attacks connect reliably against enemies
  * **Combat Efficiency**: More predictable damage output in combat
  * **Resource Conservation**: Don't waste ammunition or spell charges on misses
  * **Survival**: Particularly important against dangerous enemies

==== Class Considerations ====
  * **Warrior**: Benefits from high accuracy to land consistent hits
  * **Mage**: Important for ensuring wand shots connect
  * **Rogue**: High accuracy helps with stealth-based attacks
  * **Huntress**: Essential for ranged weapons effectiveness

==== Equipment with Accuracy Bonuses ====
  * **Weapon Enchantments**: Some enchantments improve accuracy
  * **Rings**: Some rings may provide accuracy bonuses
  * **Specialized Weapons**: Some weapons have inherent accuracy bonuses
