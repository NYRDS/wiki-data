====== Accuracy ======

Accuracy determines the chance to successfully hit a target in combat in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Description ====
Accuracy is an offensive mechanic that determines the likelihood of successfully connecting with an attack. Higher accuracy increases the chance of landing attacks against enemies, which is essential for dealing damage in combat.

==== Accuracy Mechanics ====
  * **Hit Chance**: Accuracy is used to calculate the probability of hitting a target
  * **Formula**: Hit chance is determined by comparing attacker's accuracy to defender's evasion
  * **Application**: Affects all physical attacks, including melee and ranged
  * **Equipment**: Certain items can enhance accuracy capabilities

==== Accuracy Sources ====
  * **Weapons**: Some weapons provide accuracy bonuses
  * **Rings**: [[rpd:ring_of_accuracy_item|Ring of Accuracy]] specifically increases accuracy
  * **Enchantments**: Certain weapon enchantments can enhance accuracy
  * **Buffs**: Temporary effects may increase accuracy during certain situations

==== Accuracy Factors ====
  * **Weapon Type**: Different weapons have different base accuracy values
  * **Distance**: Ranged combat may have accuracy penalties at longer ranges
  * **Status Effects**: Certain debuffs may reduce accuracy
  * **Class Abilities**: Some hero classes have natural accuracy bonuses
