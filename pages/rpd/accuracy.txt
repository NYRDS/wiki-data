====== Accuracy ======

**Accuracy** is a core combat statistic in Remixed Dungeon that determines the chance to successfully hit a target with attacks. Higher accuracy increases the probability of landing hits on enemies.

==== Calculation ====
Accuracy is calculated in the ''Char.java'' file in the ''attackSkill'' method. The formula involves:

  * **Base Attack Skill**: Determined by character level and class
  * **Equipment Bonus**: From items like [[rpd:ring_of_accuracy_item|Ring of Accuracy]]
  * **Enchantment Bonus**: From weapon enchantments that affect accuracy
  * **Exponential Scaling**: The formula uses ''Math.pow(1.4, bonus)'' to calculate accuracy multipliers

==== Impact on Combat ====
  * **Hit Chance**: Higher accuracy means more attacks successfully connect
  * **Combat Efficiency**: Critical for maximizing damage output
  * **Wand Usage**: Important for ensuring wand shots connect
  * **Melee and Ranged**: Affects both types of attacks

==== Equipment with Accuracy Benefits ====
  * [[rpd:ring_of_accuracy_item|Ring of Accuracy]] - Increases attack skill bonus directly
  * [[rpd:weightstone_item|Weightstone]] - Can be used to imbue weapons with accuracy
  * [[rpd:compound_bow_item|Compound Bow]] - Has improved accuracy over basic bows
  * Various weapons that can be imbued with accuracy enhancement

==== Related Mechanics ====
  * [[rpd:evasion|Evasion]] - The opposing stat that determines avoidance
  * [[rpd:attack_skill_mechanic|Attack Skill]] - Related combat statistic
  * [[rpd:combat_mechanic|Combat]] - Overall combat system
  * [[rpd:ranged_combat|Ranged Combat]] - Accuracy is especially important in ranged combat

  * **Exponential Factor:** Accuracy bonuses use exponential scaling: ''Math.pow(1.4, bonus)''
