====== Accuracy ======

Accuracy is a combat stat in Remixed Dungeon that determines the likelihood of successfully hitting an enemy with an attack.

==== Mechanics ====

  * Higher accuracy increases the chance to land hits
  * Some equipment, weapons, and status effects affect accuracy

==== Factors Affecting Accuracy ====

==== Special Cases ====
  * The [[rpd:doctor|Doctor]] class receives a -5 accuracy penalty when using weapons other than the [[rpd:bone_saw|Bone Saw]]
  * Some enemies have abilities that reduce player accuracy
  * Ranged attacks might have different accuracy mechanics than melee

==== Strategy ====
