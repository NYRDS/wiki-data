{{ rpd:images:potions.png|Alchemy Lab }}

Alchemy is a system in Remixed Dungeon that allows players to create useful items by combining ingredients. It's typically found in the [[rpd:sewers_level|Sewers]] and involves brewing potions, creating food, and making various other items.

==== Alchemy Mechanics ====
  * Alchemy is performed at an alchemy pot found in the [[rpd:sewers_level|Sewers Level]]
  * Players must find or collect ingredients to use in alchemy recipes
  * Different combinations of ingredients produce different items
  * Common alchemy involves brewing potions from seeds and other ingredients
  * Some recipes require specific combinations of items

  * Needs specific ingredients which may be rare or hard to find
  * Some recipes may require multiple ingredients that are difficult to obtain simultaneously
