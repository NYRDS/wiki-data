**Alchemy** is the system in Remixed Dungeon that allows players to combine items to create new, more powerful items.

==== Description ====
Alchemy is a crafting system that uses alchemy pots found in various levels to transform items into different items. It's a key mechanic for converting unwanted items into useful ones.

==== Alchemy Pot Locations ====
  * Found randomly throughout dungeon levels
  * More common in deeper levels
  * Sometimes found in shops
  * Special crafting areas may have multiple pots

==== Basic Alchemy Recipes ====
  * **Potion + Potion** → New potion (or random effect)
  * **Potion + Seed** → Different potion
  * **Scroll + Scroll** → Different scroll
  * **Potion + Arrow** → Special arrows through [[rpd:moisten|moistening]]
  * **Seed + Food** → Potion
  * **Item + Gold** → [[rpd:scroll|Scroll]] (random type)

==== Advanced Alchemy ====
  * **Moistening**: Using potions on arrows to create special ammunition
  * **Potion Creation**: Combining seeds and food to make potions
  * **Scroll Generation**: Converting items to scrolls using gold

==== Strategy ====
  * Convert unwanted items into useful ones to save inventory space
  * Create special arrows for ranged combat specialists
  * Generate scrolls when supplies run low
  * Use unwanted equipment to create healing items in emergencies

==== Tips ====
  * Always try to identify potions before alchemy (some results are dangerous)
  * Alchemy pots are safe places to dispose of cursed items
  * Combine rare seeds with food for needed potions
  * Don't waste valuable items on random alchemy experiments
