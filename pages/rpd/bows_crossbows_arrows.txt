====== Bows, Crossbows and Arrows ======

In [[rpd:start|Remixed Dungeon]], there is a new weapon class - bows.

Any class can use bows, however only the [[rpd:elf_class|elf]] can deal damage with arrows when shooting at close range. To shoot a bow, arrows are required. Bows can be used to attack in melee combat, but this is ineffective as bows have reduced melee attack speed.

  * Wooden Bow - the simplest bow. Requires 10 strength. Burns in fire.
  * Compound Bow - this bow requires 14 strength and, like the wooden bow, burns in fire.
  * Ruby Bow - the most powerful bow with the highest base damage. Requires 18 strength for use and does not burn.
  * Wooden Crossbow - requires 12 strength, burns in fire.
  * Composite Crossbow - requires 16 strength.
  * Ruby Crossbow - requires 20 strength.

In [[rpd:start|Remixed Dungeon]] there is a special item class - arrows.

To use arrows, the hero must have one of the bows in the weapon slot. Arrow damage depends on the bow. All arrows burn in fire. Arrows can be put in a quiver, which is purchased from the merchant on level 11 for 750 gold, this protects them from burning. Rogue or Huntress can use arrows as a melee weapon. Arrows can be coated with potions.

  * wooden arrow - ordinary arrow with no special effects. From this arrow, all other types of arrows are made by coating with potions
  * fire arrow - ignites the enemy on hit. Obtained from normal arrows by coating with Potion of Liquid Flame
  * poison arrow - poisons the enemy. Obtained by coating with Potion of Toxic Gas
  * paralytic arrow - paralyzes opponents. Obtained by coating with Potion of Paralytic Gas
  * frost arrow - slows down on hit. Obtained using Potion of Frost. Unlike other arrows, these cannot be found on the floor. Particularly effective against fire elementals
