====== Armor ======

{{ rpd:images:armor_hero.png|Armor }}

**Armor** provides protection against physical attacks in Remixed Dungeon. It reduces incoming damage based on its level and can be enchanted with special properties called glyphs.

==== Armor Properties ====
  * **Armor Level**: Determines the effectiveness of damage reduction
  * **Durability**: All armor has durability that decreases with use
  * **Weight**: Heavier armor can slow down the hero's movement
  * **Enchantments**: Armor can be enchanted with glyphs that provide special effects

==== Armor Tier System ====
Armor is organized into 5 tiers:
  * **Cloth Armor** (Tier 1): Basic protection, lowest armor value
  * **Leather Armor** (Tier 2): Moderate protection
  * **Mail Armor** (Tier 3): Good protection
  * **Plate Armor** (Tier 4): High protection (Scale Armor also belongs to this tier)
  * **Gothic Armor** (Tier 5): Maximum protection

==== Armor Reduction Formula ====
The damage reduction formula is: 
  * Reduction = armorValue * 0.06f / (1 + 0.06f * armorValue)
  * With glyph enhancements, this can be increased further

==== Armor Enchantments (Glyphs) ====
Armor can be enchanted with various glyphs that provide special effects:
  * **Glyph of Affection**: Charms enemies on block
  * **Glyph of Anti-Entropy**: Heals the hero and chills enemies on block
  * **Glyph of Bounce**: Reflects damage back to attackers
  * **Glyph of Displacement**: Teleports attackers away on hit
  * **Glyph of Entanglement**: Roots the hero but provides armor bonus
  * **Glyph of Metabolism**: Converts damage to healing
  * **Glyph of Multiplicity**: Creates mirror images when taking damage
  * **Glyph of Potential**: Charges hero's wand on hit
  * **Glyph of Stench**: Releases toxic gas when blocking attacks
  * **Glyph of Viscosity**: Delays damage until armor is removed

==== Acquisition ====
  * Found randomly throughout the dungeon
  * Available in shops
  * Dropped by certain enemies
  * Found in chests and other containers

==== Upgrade and Identification ====
  * Armor can be upgraded using [[rpd:scroll_of_upgrade_item|Scroll of Upgrade]]
  * Higher tier armor is generally better than upgrading lower tier armor
  * Unidentified armor shows as "armor" with unknown stats

==== Strategy ====
  * Higher tier armor provides exponentially better protection
  * Consider the weight of armor and its effect on movement speed
  * Choose glyphs based on your playstyle and character build
  * Balance armor level with mobility for your character class
  * Prioritize armor upgrades for early game survival
