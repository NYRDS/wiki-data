====== Armor ======

{{ rpd:images:armor_tiers.png|Armor Tiers }}

**Armor** provides protection to the hero by reducing the damage taken from attacks and environmental effects. Different types of armor offer varying degrees of protection and special properties.

==== Armor Mechanics ====
  * **Damage Reduction**: Armor reduces incoming physical damage based on its level and condition
  * **Armor Level**: Higher level armor provides better protection
  * **Durability**: Armor degrades with use but can be maintained
  * **Encumbrance**: Heavier armor may slow movement speed
  * **Required Strength**: Lower strength heroes take penalty damage when using armor that requires higher strength
  * **Enchantments**: Armor can be enhanced with special properties through enchantments
