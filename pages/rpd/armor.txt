  * **Durability** - Armor degrades with use over time
  * **Required Strength** - Lower strength heroes take penalty damage
  * **Speed Factor** - Heavy armor may slow movement

==== Armor Specialties ====

  * Class-specific armors provide additional benefits to specific hero classes

==== Upgrades ====
