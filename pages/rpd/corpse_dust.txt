====== Corpse Dust ======
Corpse dust, as in the base game, is obtained from skeleton remains during the Wand maker's quest. 

However, unlike in the base game, it can be equipped, and equipping corpse dust gives the effect [[New_effects#Bloodlust|Bloodlust]].

While corpse dust is equipped, regardless of the item being cursed or not, the player will randomly take small amounts of damage ranging from 1 to 4.
