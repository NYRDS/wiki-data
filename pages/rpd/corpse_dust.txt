Corpse Dust is a cursed quest item obtained during the [[rpd:wandmaker|Wandmaker]]'s quest. It is found on skeleton remains in the Prison level.

==== Properties ====
  * **Type**: Quest Item (Cursed)
  * **Cursed**: Always cursed and cannot be uncursed
  * **Identified**: Always identified
  * **Effect**: When equipped, provides Bloodlust buff with attack damage doubled but random self-damage

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Bloodlust Effect**: When equipped, provides the Bloodlust buff which:
    * Doubles attack damage (attackProc damage * 2)
    * Randomly causes 1-5 damage to the player (10% chance per turn when HP > 20% of max HP)
    * Provides visual indicator (Bloodlust icon)

==== Acquisition ====
  * Obtained from skeleton remains during the [[rpd:wandmaker|Wandmaker]]'s quest in Prison level
  * The Wandmaker has a 50% chance of asking for either Corpse Dust or Rotberry seeds as part of his quest
  * Found on skeleton heaps in Prison level when the quest requires Corpse Dust
  * If no suitable skeleton heap exists, it may be placed by itself

==== Strategy ====
  * Provides a high-risk, high-reward combat option

  * Self-damage can be dangerous, especially when HP is low
  * Consider using when high damage output is needed but be aware of the self-harm risk
