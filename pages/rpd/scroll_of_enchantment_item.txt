====== Scroll of Enchantment ======

{{ rpd:images:scroll_Enchant.png|Scroll of Enchantment }}

**Scroll of Enchantment** is a scroll in Remixed Dungeon that can apply magical enchantments to weapons. In Remixed Dungeon, this functionality is typically handled by the [[rpd:scroll_of_weapon_upgrade_item|Scroll of Weapon Upgrade]], which can imbue an unenchanted weapon with a random enchantment.

==== Description ====
The Scroll of Enchantment is a magical scroll that can imbue weapons with special magical properties. When used on a weapon, it applies a random enchantment to the weapon, enhancing its capabilities in combat.

==== Effects ====
  * Applies a random enchantment to a weapon
  * Does not increase the weapon's upgrade level
  * Preserves existing enchantments on weapons
  * Allows upgrading of weapons that cannot normally be upgraded

==== Usage ====
  1. Select the scroll from your inventory
  2. Choose the weapon to enchant
  3. The enchantment is applied to the weapon

==== Notes ====
In Remixed Dungeon, this functionality may be implemented differently than in other Pixel Dungeon variants. The [[rpd:scroll_of_weapon_upgrade_item|Scroll of Weapon Upgrade]] serves a similar purpose, being able to imbue unenchanted weapons with random enchantments while also upgrading them.
