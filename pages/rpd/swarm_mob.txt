====== Swarm Mob ======

{{ rpd:images:swarm_mob.png|Swarm }}

The **Swarm** is a group of small insects that act as a single enemy unit in Remixed Dungeon. It's an unusual mob that splits into multiple smaller swarms when defeated.

==== Overview ====
A Swarm consists of dozens of small insects that appear as a single creature but function differently from typical mobs. The Swarm is immune to most status effects due to its nature as a collection of small creatures.

==== Stats ====
  * **HP:** 50 (HT: 50)
  * **Defense Skill:** 10
  * **Attack Skill:** 12
  * **Damage:** 1-6
  * **Armor:** 0 DR (Defense Rating)
  * **EXP for Kill:** 7
  * **Maximum Level:** 10
  * **Characteristics:** Immune to most status effects (poison, paralysis, etc.)

==== Abilities ====
  * **Splitting:** When killed, splits into 2 smaller swarms, each with 50% of the original's HP
  * **Immunity:** Immune to most status effects due to its swarm nature
  * **Speed:** Relatively fast, moves every turn but may have different AI behavior

==== Occurrence ====
  * **Primary Location:** Found throughout the Prison level and deeper dungeon levels
  * **Spawn Frequency:** Uncommon in later dungeon levels
  * **Group Behavior:** Usually found alone

==== Strategy ====
  * Use area-of-effect attacks or spells to damage multiple swarms at once
  * Focus on one swarm at a time to prevent multiplication
  * Fire-based attacks and AoE spells work well against swarms
  * Be careful not to let them split multiple times, leading to a large number of enemies
  * Area effect attacks like the Scroll of Psionic Blast or Fire can be very effective

==== Special Notes ====
  * The splitting mechanic can lead to exponential multiplication if not handled carefully
  * Due to its nature, many status effects are ineffective against swarms
  * Swarms are generally not very dangerous individually but can overwhelm with numbers
