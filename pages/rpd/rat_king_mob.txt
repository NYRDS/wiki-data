==== Description ====
The Rat King is a powerful rat-like entity that appears in a unique area within the dungeon. Despite being aggressive if attacked, it initially behaves more like an NPC, sleeping in its lair until disturbed.

==== Behavior ====
  * Initially sleeps in its room until approached
  * When approached, it becomes agitated and starts wandering
  * If attacked multiple times, it becomes hostile and attacks the player
  * Has a unique interaction system - it doesn't immediately become hostile when approached
  * Drops the [[rpd:rat_king_crown_item|Rat King Crown]] as a reward

==== Quest Mechanics ====
  * The Rat King quest is initiated by finding the [[rpd:rat_king_crown_item|Rat King Crown]] elsewhere in the dungeon
  * The crown teleports the player to the Rat King's lair
  * Players can interact with the Rat King multiple times before it becomes hostile
  * The quest is part of the early game progression system

==== Strategy ====
  * Approach carefully and understand the interaction system before attacking
  * The Rat King is not initially hostile, so players can observe its behavior
  * Be prepared for a difficult fight once it becomes hostile
  * The quest reward (Rat King Crown) is important for progression
