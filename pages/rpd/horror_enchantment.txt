====== Horror Enchantment ======

**Horror** is an enchantment available for weapons in Remixed Dungeon. When successfully attacking an enemy, it has a chance to apply the [[rpd:terror_buff|Terror]] status effect, causing the affected enemy to flee in fear.

==== Effects ====
  * **Primary Effect**: On successful hit, has a chance to inflict different effects based on the target:
    * **Enemies**: Inflicts [[rpd:terror_buff|Terror]], causing them to flee in fear (for duration of Terror.DURATION)
    * **Hero**: Inflicts [[rpd:vertigo_buff|Vertigo]], causing disorientation
  * **Chance**: Increases with weapon level (lvl 0: 20%, lvl 1: 33%, lvl 2: 43%)
  * **Duration**: The terror effect has a limited duration but causes the enemy to flee
  * **Target**: Applies to any character hit by the weapon with this enchantment
  * **Terror Effect**: Causes affected enemies to be horrified and run away from combat

==== Acquisition ====
  * Found on weapons in the dungeon as a random enchantment

  * Can appear on any weapon that can receive enchantments
  * Cannot be applied to already enchanted weapons without special methods

==== Strategy ====
  * Highly effective for controlling enemy positioning
  * Useful for escaping dangerous situations

  * Particularly effective against single powerful enemies that can be terrorized to run away
  * Note that terrorized enemies will return to normal after the duration expires
