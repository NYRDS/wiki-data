{{ rpd:images:fetidrat_sprite.png|Fetid Rat Sprite }}

The **Fetid Rat** is a special mob that appears in Remixed Dungeon as part of the Ghost quest for Necromancer hero class, or as an alternative reward for the Ghost quest for other classes.

==== Description ====
The Fetid Rat is a diseased-looking rat that follows the player character. It appears as part of the Ghost's quest line, either as a reward for Necromancer players who choose to befriend the Ghost, or as an alternative to the Dried Rose quest for non-Necromancers who convince the Ghost to give up his quest for revenge.

==== Stats ====
  * **HP:** 15
  * **HT:** 15 (Max HP)

  * **Damage Reduction:** 2
  * **EXP for Kill:** 0
  * **Level:** Not a standard dungeon mob
  * **Speed:** Normal

==== Special Abilities ====
  * **Random Gas Cloud:** On defense (when attacked), releases a random gas cloud with a 50-cell radius around itself. The gas type is randomly selected from three possibilities:
    * **Paralytic Gas:** May paralyze nearby characters
    * **Confusion Gas:** May confuse nearby characters with Vertigo effect
    * **Toxic Gas:** May poison nearby characters
  * **Immunity:** Immune to its own specific gas type immunity (Paralysis, Vertigo, or Toxic Gas depending on variant)
  * **Additional Immunity:** Immune to Paralysis effects regardless of variant

==== Drops ====
  * [[rpd:giant_rat_skull_item|Giant Rat Skull]] (100% guaranteed drop)

==== Quest Context ====
  * Part of the Ghost quest line
  * Appears as an alternative quest reward for non-Necromancer classes
  * For Necromancer class, appears as a reward for choosing to befriend the Ghost rather than help him
  * Serves as a potential pet or ally for the player

==== Location ====
  * Does not spawn naturally in dungeon levels
  * Only appears as part of the Ghost quest completion
  * Part of the Necromancer-specific quest content

==== Strategy ====
  * Be cautious when attacking, as the paralytic gas effect can impact both you and other nearby enemies
  * The paralytic gas ability activates on defense, not attack
  * Since it drops a valuable quest item (Giant Rat Skull), consider the tactical implications of killing it
