====== Rotberry Level Object ======

{{ rpd:images:rotberry_level_object.png|Rotberry Level Object }}

==== Description ====
The **Rotberry Level Object** is a special plant found growing in the dungeon. Berries of this shrub taste like sweet, sweet death. When interacted with, the Rotberry produces toxic gas and drops another [[rpd:rotberry_seed_item|Rotberry Seed]].

==== Effects ====
  * Produces a cloud of toxic gas (100 units) at the plant's location
  * Causes temporary root effect (3 turns) on the character that interacts with it
  * Drops a [[rpd:rotberry_seed_item|Rotberry Seed]] when activated
  * The plant disappears after being activated

==== Mechanics ====
  * Rotberry level objects can be found growing in the dungeon
  * They can also be grown by planting [[rpd:rotberry_seed_item|Rotberry Seeds]]
  * When activated, they generate toxic gas which can harm the player or enemies
  * Provides access to additional [[rpd:rotberry_seed_item|Rotberry Seeds]] for planting

==== Strategy ====
  * Rotberry level objects are dangerous but can be beneficial if used strategically
  * Use the toxic gas to harm enemies while staying out of the gas cloud
  * The roots effect is temporary but can be inconvenient in combat
  * Consider using the gas to clear groups of weak enemies
  * Plant seeds in safe areas to create your own gas-generating traps
