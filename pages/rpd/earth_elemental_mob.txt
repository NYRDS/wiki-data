**Earth Elemental** is an elemental mob found in grassy areas. Based on source code: [[code:RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/nyrds/pixeldungeon/mobs/elementals/EarthElemental.java|EarthElemental.java]]

==== Description ====
Earth elementals are earth masses driven by concentrated nature forces. They can literally root you to the ground and cause regrowth in appropriate terrain. They are heavily armored creatures with high HP but slower attack speed. They are immune to many status effects and can cause beneficial regrowth when attacking in certain terrains.

==== Stats ====
  * **HP/HT**: Depth * 10 + 1 (scales with dungeon depth)
  * **Defense Skill**: Depth / 2 + 1
  * **Attack Skill**: (Depth / 2 + 1) / 2 + 1 (half of defense skill plus 1)
  * **Min Damage**: HT / 5
  * **Max Damage**: HT / 5 (same as min damage - fixed damage output)
  * **Damage Resistance**: Depth + 1
  * **Exp for Kill**: Depth + 1
  * **Max Level**: Depth + 2
  * **Speed**: Normal speed, but 0.5x on liquid terrain
  * **Kind**: Determined by depth (min(depth/5, 4))

==== Special Abilities ====
  * **Regrowth Attack**: On attack, has a 50% chance to cause regrowth in the targeted cell if it's a valid terrain type (EMPTY, EMBERS, EMPTY_DECO, GRASS, HIGH_GRASS) for 15 turns at power level max(Depth+1, 10)
  * **Slow in Liquid**: Speed is halved when on liquid terrain
  * **Terrain Interaction**: Can cause regrowth when attacking on empty, ember, empty_deco, grass, or high_grass terrain

==== Immunities ====
Earth Elementals are immune to:
  * [[rpd:roots_buff|Roots]]
  * [[rpd:paralysis_buff|Paralysis]]
  * [[rpd:stun_buff|Stun]]
  * [[rpd:toxic_gas|Toxic Gas]]
  * [[rpd:burning_buff|Burning]]
  * [[rpd:bleeding_buff|Bleeding]]

==== Drops ====
  * [[rpd:earthroot_seed|Earthroot Seed]]: 10% chance to drop an Earthroot seed

==== Spawn Locations ====
  * **Grass Areas**: Earth Elementals can spawn in grassy areas as defined in [[code:RemixedDungeon/src/main/assets/levelsDesc/Bestiary.json|Bestiary.json]]
  * ''Spawn definition: "GRASS":{"EarthElemental":1} in Bestiary.json''

==== Behavior ====
  * Adjusts stats based on dungeon depth through the IDepthAdjustable interface
  * Statistics scale with dungeon depth
  * Speed reduced by half when on liquid terrain
  * When attacking, has a 50% chance to cause regrowth on appropriate terrain types
  * The regrowth effect can create favorable terrain for the Earth Elemental and hinder player mobility

==== Strategy ====
  * Fight in non-vegetation terrain to prevent the regrowth effect
  * Use liquid terrain to your advantage, as Earth Elementals move slower there
  * Avoid standing on grass or other vegetation when fighting Earth Elementals
  * Be prepared for the Earth Elemental to potentially create advantageous terrain for itself
  * The high HP and damage reduction make these enemies quite durable
  * Elemental creature with fixed damage output (min damage equals max damage)
