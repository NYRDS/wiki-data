**Earth Elementals** are sturdy, defensive enemies found in the deeper levels of Remixed Dungeon.

==== Description ====
Earth Elementals are creatures of stone and mud with high defense and health. They move slowly but pack a powerful punch. These enemies are particularly resilient and require focused attacks to bring down.

==== Stats ====
  * **Level:** 10
  * **Health:** 35
  * **Attack:** 12-24
  * **Defense:** 15
  * **Speed:** 0.8 (slow)
  * **Resistances:** Physical damage, [[rpd:bleeding_buff|Bleeding]], [[rpd:paralysis_buff|Paralysis]], [[rpd:poison_buff|Poison]]
  * **Vulnerabilities:** [[rpd:shock|Shocking]] effects and high-damage single attacks

==== Special Abilities ====
  * **High Defense:** Significantly reduces incoming physical damage
  * **Steady:** Immune to knockback effects
  * **Regeneration:** Slowly regenerates health while on earth/stone terrain
  * **Earth Armor:** Gains additional damage reduction when fighting on earthen terrain

==== Loot ====
  * [[rpd:gold_item|Gold]] (2-6 pieces)
  * Occasionally drops a [[rpd:stone_item|Stone]]

==== Strategy ====
  * Use high-damage attacks to overcome their high defense
  * Try to fight them away from earthen terrain where they are strongest
  * Magic or special effect weapons may be more effective
  * Don't let them corner you, as they can be quite dangerous up close
  * Stunning or slowing them is less effective due to their inherent resistances
