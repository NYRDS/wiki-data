**Berserker Armor** is the upgraded form of [[rpd:warrior_armor|Warrior Armor]] for the Warrior class, obtained when the Warrior subclass is unlocked and equipped.

==== Overview ====
Berserker Armor is the advanced form of [[rpd:warrior_armor|Warrior Armor]] that becomes available when the Warrior character chooses the Berserker subclass. It enhances the Heroic Leap ability of the Warrior Armor and provides additional combat benefits through the Rage ability.

==== Special Ability: Rage ====
  * **Effect**: When the Berserker's health drops below 50%, they enter a rage state
  * **Damage Bonus**: While raging, the Berserker deals additional damage with all attacks
  * **Damage Reduction**: While raging, the Berserker takes less damage from attacks
  * **Healing**: While raging, the Berserker regenerates health over time
  * **Trigger**: Automatically activates when health drops below 50% (not when damaged below 50% while already raging)
  * **Duration**: Lasts until health rises above 50% or the Berserker takes no damage for a period

==== Creation ====
  * Requires: [[rpd:warrior_armor|Warrior Armor]] (crafted with Armor Kit) + Warrior subclass selection
  * Character: Only available to Warrior characters who select the Berserker subclass
  * Method: Automatically upgrades Warrior Armor when Berserker subclass is chosen

==== Benefits ====
  * Maintains the Heroic Leap ability of Warrior Armor
  * Adds the powerful Rage ability for survival in dangerous situations
  * Excellent for aggressive play styles
  * Combines mobility and survival mechanics effectively

==== Strategy ====
Berserker Armor is particularly effective when fighting in a high-risk manner:
  * Deliberately take damage to trigger the rage ability when fighting powerful enemies
  * Use the damage reduction and healing to sustain through difficult encounters
  * The higher damage output during rage makes it excellent for berserker combat tactics
  * Combine with Heroic Leap to position yourself optimally for rage-triggered fights
