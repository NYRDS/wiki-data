==== Notes ====
The Goo boss is found in the sewers area of the dungeon. Defeating it often results in acid pools that can damage the player, making positioning crucial during the battle. Goo has a unique "pump up" mechanic that makes it significantly more dangerous after it performs a special action that increases its stats temporarily.
