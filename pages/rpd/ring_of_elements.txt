  * **Upgrade Benefits:** Higher upgrades provide stronger resistance chance and duration reduction

===== Mechanics =====
  * Resistance effect chance: Random chance of (level + 3) >= 3, meaning for positive levels (or 0), the ring always provides resistance
  * Duration factor: (2 + 0.5 * level) / (2 + level) - with positive levels, this reduces duration of debuffs
