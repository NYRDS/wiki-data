{{ rpd:images:item_BattleAxe.png|Battle Axe }}

**Battle Axe** is a heavy melee weapon in Remixed Dungeon. The enormous steel head of this battle axe puts considerable heft behind each stroke.

==== Description ====
The Battle Axe is a heavy Tier 4 melee weapon. It's designed for players who want to maximize their damage output, trading speed for devastating blows. Due to its size and weight, it occupies both the main weapon slot and the left hand slot, preventing dual wielding.

==== Stats ====
  * **Tier:** 4
  * **Damage:** 4-15 (MIN=4, MAX=15)
  * **Speed:** 1.2x slower than standard weapons (Heavy attack animation)
  * **Accuracy:** 1.0x (standard accuracy)
  * **Strength Required:** 15
  * **Durability:** Normal
  * **Weight:** 5
  * **Price:** 60 gold (when sold to shops - price calculated as damage * 4)

==== Properties ====
  * **Two-handed:** Cannot be used with a second weapon in the left hand (blocks left hand slot)
  * **Heavy Attack:** Uses the heavy attack animation when wielded
  * **Upgrade Potential:** Can be upgraded with [[rpd:scroll_of_upgrade_item|Scrolls of Upgrade]]
  * **Enchantments:** Compatible with [[rpd:weapon_enchantments|weapon enchantments]]

==== Strategy ====
  * Best suited for players with sufficient strength (15+) to wield effectively
  * Excellent for finishing off weakened enemies with high damage output
  * The slower attack speed requires careful positioning and timing
  * Due to blocking the left hand slot, it's incompatible with shields or dual wielding
  * Effective against enemies with low armor values where the high damage can shine
  * Upgrading increases both damage and required strength (by 2 per upgrade level)
