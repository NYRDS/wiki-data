====== Skill Points ======

**Skill Points** are the primary resource system in Remixed Dungeon used for casting spells and performing special abilities.

==== Description ====
Skill Points are the underlying resource system that powers spells and special abilities in Remixed Dungeon. Rather than a traditional mana system, the game uses skill points that are accumulated over time and consumed when casting spells.

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Regeneration:** Skill points regenerate passively through the [[rpd:mana_regeneration|Mana Regeneration]] buff
  * **Consumption:** Different spells consume different amounts of skill points when cast
  * **Accumulation:** Points accumulate gradually over time based on various factors
  * **Maximum:** Character has a maximum skill point capacity that can be increased
  * **Implementation:** Managed through methods in [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/watabou/pixeldungeon/actors/Char.java|Char.java]] (getSkillPoints, spendSkillPoints, accumulateSkillPoints, etc.)

==== Regeneration ====
  * Regenerates 1 skill point every 20/(1.2^bonus) turns in safe areas (ManaRegeneration buff implementation)
  * Faster regeneration with bonuses from game facilitations and buffs
  * Game facilitation ''FAST_MANA_REGENERATION'' provides +10 bonus
  * Other buffs may provide additional regeneration bonuses via manaRegenerationBonus()
  * In unsafe areas (enemies present), 1 skill point is accumulated immediately

==== Spell Costs ====
  * Different spells have different skill point costs (default is 5 as defined in [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/nyrds/pixeldungeon/mechanics/spells/Spell.java|Spell.java]])
  * Examples: Healing spell costs 10 skill points, Magic Torch costs 1, Ignite costs 2
  * Cost is consumed when the spell is cast successfully
  * Spell costs are defined in individual spell classes or in custom spell configurations

==== Restoration ====
  * [[rpd:mana_potion|Mana Potion]] - Restores 1/3 of max skill points when consumed
  * [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/nyrds/pixeldungeon/items/drinks/ManaPotion.java|ManaPotion.java]] implementation
  * Some equipment or abilities may provide skill point restoration

==== Classes That Use Skill Points ====
  * All classes can use spells that consume skill points if they have access to them
  * Classes with higher spell affinity may have more efficient usage or bonuses
  * Different classes may have access to different spell types
  * Some hero subclasses like Lich have special interactions with skill points

==== Strategy ====
  * Manage skill points carefully during extended fights
  * Carry [[rpd:mana_potion|Mana Potions]] for magic-heavy sections
  * Balance offensive spells with skill point conservation
  * Consider equipment that improves skill point regeneration
  * Plan spell usage around regeneration timing
