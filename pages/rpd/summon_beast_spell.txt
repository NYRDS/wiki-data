**Beast Call** is a Huntress-affinity spell in Remixed Pixel Dungeon that attempts to summon a horde of mighty beasts to your command.

==== Description ====
Attempt to summon a horde of mighty beasts to your command. Actual results may vary. The spell summons creatures around the caster based on their skill level, with different types of beasts appearing depending on the caster's level.

==== Stats ====
  * **Magic Affinity:** Huntress
  * **Targeting:** self (summons around the caster)
  * **Level:** 4
  * **Mana Cost:** 20
  * **Cast Time:** 1 turn
  * **Special Effects:** summons allied creatures

==== Mechanics ====
The spell functions by:
  * Checking all adjacent cells around the caster (including diagonals)
  * For each empty and passable cell, there's a chance to spawn a creature
  * Chance to spawn: (1 - 1/skillLevel) - so higher skill level = higher chance
  * The type of creature depends on skill level: from simple creatures like Snail/Rat (low level) to powerful ones like Scorpio/Worm (high level)
  * **Note:** The original Lua script had an error in the formula that determines which creature to summon, which has been corrected in this documentation
  * Summoned beasts become pets under the caster's command
  * Creatures summoned: Snail, Rat, Crab, Swarm, Bat, Spinner, Scorpio, Worm (in order of strength)

==== Usage ====
The Beast Call spell can be used for:
  * **Primary effect:** Creating allied creatures to fight alongside the player
  * **Strategic applications:** Distracting enemies or absorbing damage
  * **Utility purposes:** Providing additional offensive capability in difficult situations

==== Classes ====
Classes that can use this spell include:
  * Classes with Huntress affinity (e.g., [[rpd:huntress|Huntress class]])
  * Other classes that gain access through special means

==== Strategy ====
How to effectively use the Beast Call spell:
  * **Best situations:** Use when surrounded by enemies to create distractions or when additional DPS is needed
  * **Synergies:** Works well with crowd control abilities to protect summoned creatures
  * **Timing considerations:** Best used when there are multiple empty adjacent cells available
  * **Skill level impact:** Higher skill level increases both the chance to summon and the power level of creatures
  * **Environmental awareness:** Position yourself where there are clear spaces for creatures to spawn

==== Technical Details ====
  * **Implementation:** Lua script located at ''scripts/spells/SummonBeast.lua''
  * **Summoning Logic:** ''math.random() > 1/skillLevel'' determines spawn chance
  * **Creature Selection:** ''beasts[math.max(1, math.min(math.floor(math.random(skillLevel/2, skillLevel+1)), #beasts))]'' determines creature type (the original formula was incorrect in the script)
  * **Beast Types:** Snail, Rat, Crab, Swarm, Bat, Spinner, Scorpio, Worm (in order of increasing strength)
  * **Allied Status:** Summoned creatures use ''makePet(caster)'' to become player allies
