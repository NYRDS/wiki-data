====== Mechanical Enemies ======

In Remixed Dungeon, mechanical enemies are special types of enemies that behave differently from organic enemies. These enemies often have special resistances and immunities that make them unique to fight.

==== List of Mechanical Enemies ====
  * [[rpd:dm300|DM-300]] - The first major mechanical boss found in the Goo level
  * [[rpd:war_hammer|War Hammer]] - A mechanical boss in the Prison level
  * [[rpd:ice_guardian|Ice Guardian]] - A mechanical enemy in the Caves level
  * [[rpd:golden_statue|Golden Statue]] - Mechanical statues that appear throughout the dungeon

==== Common Characteristics ====
  * **Poison Immunity**: Mechanical enemies are typically immune to poison effects
  * **Bleeding Immunity**: Immune to bleeding damage
  * **Cripple Immunity**: Immune to cripple effects
  * **Frost Resistance**: Usually resistant to frost effects
  * **Piercing Resistance**: Some mechanical enemies have reduced damage from piercing attacks
  * **Healing Immunity**: Abilities that heal enemies will not affect mechanical enemies

==== Tactics ====
  * Use physical attacks that don't rely on status effects
  * Avoid using poison-based weapons or spells against them
  * Focus on direct damage rather than DoT (Damage over Time) effects
  * Some mechanical enemies may have special weaknesses to specific damage types
