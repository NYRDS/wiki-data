{{ rpd:images:rat_king_crown_artifacts.png|Rat King Crown }}

The **Rat King's Crown** is an [[rpd:artifacts|artifact]] in Remixed Pixel Dungeon that grants control over rats.

==== Description ====
Gold crown of His Ratness, symbol of everrating Power. Wearing this crown allows the player to command rats instead of fighting them.

==== Acquisition ====
  * Dropped by the [[rpd:rat_king|Rat King]] boss on floor 5
  * Can only be obtained by choosing to fight the Rat King rather than taking the [[rpd:rat_king_crown|Crown]] directly

==== Mechanics ====
  * When attacking a rat while wearing the crown, it becomes your pet instead of taking damage
  * Effect does not work on [[rpd:pseudorat|Pseudo-Rats]]
  * Activates via the Rat King Aura buff when worn
  * The rat says "I will obey you" when successfully converted

==== Strategy ====
  * Useful for farming rats as allies in later parts of the dungeon
  * Allows for unique tactical approaches using rat minions
  * Consider the strategic value of having a rat army

==== Class Implementation ====
  * [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/nyrds/pixeldungeon/items/common/RatKingCrown.java|RatKingCrown.java]]
