{{ rpd:images:rat_king_crown_artifacts.png|Rat King Crown }}

The **Rat King's Crown** is an [[rpd:artifacts|artifact]] in Remixed Pixel Dungeon that grants control over rats.

==== Description ====
Gold crown of His Ratness, symbol of everrating Power. Wearing this crown allows the player to command rats instead of fighting them.

==== Acquisition ====
  * Dropped by the [[rpd:rat_king_mob|Rat King]] boss on floor 5
  * Can only be obtained by choosing to fight the Rat King rather than taking the [[rpd:rat_king_crown_item|Crown]] directly

==== Mechanics ====
  * When attacking a rat while wearing the crown, it becomes your pet instead of taking damage (implemented via the ''attackProc'' method in ''RatKingAuraBuff'')
  * Effect only works on [[rpd:rats|Rats]] (class ''Rat''), does not work on other rat-like creatures
  * Activates via the ''RatKingAuraBuff'' when worn
  * The rat becomes a pet with the message "I will obey you" when successfully converted (via ''Mob.makePet'' method)
  * Requires the artifact to be equipped to function

==== Properties ====
  * **Type**: [[rpd:artifacts|Artifact]]
  * **Image**: ''artifacts.png'' (index 17)
  * **Identified**: Always identified (isIdentified() returns true)

==== Strategy ====
  * Useful for farming rats as allies in later parts of the dungeon
  * Allows for unique tactical approaches using rat minions
  * Consider the strategic value of having a rat army

==== Class Implementation ====
  * [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/nyrds/pixeldungeon/items/common/RatKingCrown.java|RatKingCrown.java]]
  * [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/res/values/strings_all.xml#L97-L100|String Resources]]

==== Content Verification ====
  * **Information Source**: ''com.nyrds.pixeldungeon.items.common.RatKingCrown.java''
  * **Stats Verification**: ''attackProc'' method confirms rat control mechanism
  * **Effect Descriptions**: Extracted from ''strings_all.xml'' resources (''RatKingCrown_Name'' and ''RatKingCrown_Info'')
  * **Code References**: ''RatKingAuraBuff.attackProc'' method handles the rat conversion via ''Mob.makePet''
