{{ rpd:images:rat_king_crown_item.png|Rat King's Crown }}

The **Rat King's Crown** is an [[rpd:artifacts|artifact]] in Remixed Dungeon that grants control over rats.

===== Description =====
Gold crown of His Ratness, symbol of everrating Power. Wearing this crown allows the player to command rats instead of fighting them.

===== Acquisition =====
  * Dropped by the [[rpd:rat_king_mob|Rat King]] boss on floor 5
  * Can only be obtained by choosing to fight the Rat King rather than taking the [[rpd:crown_item|Crown]] directly

===== Mechanics =====
  * When attacking a rat while wearing the crown, it becomes your pet instead of taking damage (implemented via the ''attackProc'' method in ''RatKingAuraBuff'')
  * Effect only works on [[rpd:rats|Rats]] (class ''Rat''), does not work on other rat-like creatures
  * Activates via the ''RatKingAuraBuff'' when worn
  * The rat becomes a pet with the message "I will obey you" when successfully converted (via ''Mob.makePet'' method)
  * Requires the artifact to be equipped to function

===== Properties =====
  * **Type**: [[rpd:artifacts|Artifact]]
  * **Image**: ''artifacts.png'' (index 17)
  * **Identified**: Always identified (isIdentified() returns true)

===== Strategy =====
  * Useful for farming rats as allies in later parts of the dungeon
  * Allows for unique tactical approaches using rat minions
  * Consider the strategic value of having a rat army

===== Data Validation =====
  * Information source: Java Class ''com.nyrds.pixeldungeon.items.common.RatKingCrown''
  * Mechanics verification: ''attackProc'' method in ''RatKingAuraBuff'' confirms rat control mechanism when defender is instance of ''Rat''
  * Effect descriptions: Based on string resources from values/strings_all.xml ("RatKingCrownBuff_Info")
  * Name verification: Confirmed from string resources ("RatKingCrown_Name")
