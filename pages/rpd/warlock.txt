The **Warlock** is a mastery subclass for the Mage class in Remixed Dungeon. After killing an enemy, the Warlock consumes its soul, which heals wounds and satisfies hunger.

==== Unlocking ====
The Warlock subclass can be unlocked by using a Tome of Mastery after defeating the second boss (Tengu). This subclass is specifically available to the Mage class.

==== Special Mechanics ====
After killing an enemy, the Warlock consumes its soul, which:
* Heals the hero's wounds (healing amount: min(max HP - current HP, 1 + (dungeon depth - 1) / 5))
* Satisfies hunger (restores 10 hunger points)

==== Special Armor ====
Using an Armor Kit on any armor will transform it into the [[rpd:warlock_armor|Warlock Armor]], which is specifically designed for this subclass. Warlock Armor has special restrictions and can only be equipped by heroes with the Warlock subclass.

==== Advantages ====
  * Self-sufficiency in healing after killing enemies
  * Can manage hunger by killing enemies
  * Provides sustainability in long dungeon runs
  * Reduces reliance on healing potions
  * Particularly effective in areas with many enemies

==== Disadvantages ====
  * Healing is dependent on killing enemies
  * Less effective against enemies that are difficult to kill
  * May encourage aggressive playstyle
  * Limited effectiveness in areas with few enemies
