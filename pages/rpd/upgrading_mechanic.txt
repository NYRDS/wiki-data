====== Upgrading Mechanic ======

**Upgrading** is the process of improving items in Remixed Dungeon using Scrolls of Upgrade.

==== Description ====
Upgrading is a core game mechanic that allows players to enhance their equipment. By using Scrolls of Upgrade on weapons, armor, rings, wands, and other items, players can increase these items' effectiveness and gain special benefits.

==== Items That Can Be Upgraded ====
  * **Weapons:** Increase damage and accuracy, gain enchantments
  * **Armor:** Increase protection, gain glyphs
  * **Rings:** Increase effectiveness of ring abilities
  * **Wands:** Increase charge capacity and effectiveness
  * **Other Items:** Some artifacts can also be upgraded

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Scroll of Upgrade:** Primary method for upgrading items
  * **Safe Upgrading:** First 3 upgrades are guaranteed to succeed
  * **Risks:** Higher-level upgrades have a chance of destruction
  * **Curses:** Cursed items will be damaged instead of upgraded

==== Benefits ====
  * **Weapons:** Higher damage output, better accuracy, enchantment slots
  * **Armor:** Higher defense, better evasion, glyph slots
  * **Rings:** Stronger effects
  * **Wands:** More charges, potentially faster recharge

==== Risks ====
  * **Destruction:** Higher-level upgrades have a chance to destroy the item
  * **Curses:** If a cursed item is upgraded, it will be damaged instead of improved
  * **Opportunity Cost:** Upgrading requires scrolls that could be used elsewhere
