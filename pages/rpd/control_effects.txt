====== Control Effects ======

{{ rpd:images:charm_buff.png|Control Effect }}

Control effects are status effects or spells that limit the actions of a character (either ally or enemy) in some way. Common control effects include charm, root, stun, fear, and paralysis.

==== Types of Control Effects ====
  * **[[rpd:charm_buff|Charm]]** - Makes an enemy fight for you temporarily
  * **[[rpd:roots_buff|Root]]** - Prevents movement for a number of turns
  * **[[rpd:stun_buff|Stun]]** - Prevents all actions for a number of turns
  * **[[rpd:fear_buff|Fear]]** - Makes an enemy flee from combat
  * **[[rpd:paralysis_buff|Paralysis]]** - Prevents all actions but not necessarily for a fixed duration
  * **[[rpd:vertigo_buff|Vertigo]]** - Causes disorientation, making targets attack randomly
  * **[[rpd:amok_buff|Amok]]** - Makes enemies attack randomly

==== Countering Control Effects ====
  * **[[rpd:potion_of_purity_item|Potion of Purity]]** can remove many control effects
  * Some rings and armor provide resistance to various control effects
  * Some control effects have a chance to break naturally when the affected character takes damage

==== Strategy ====
Control effects are powerful in combat:
  * Use crowd control to manage multiple enemies effectively
  * Apply to powerful single enemies to neutralize them temporarily
  * Combine with damage-over-time effects for maximum effectiveness
  * Be aware of how long each control effect lasts
