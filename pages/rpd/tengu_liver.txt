{{ rpd:images:tengu_liver_item.png|Tengu Liver }}

==== Description ====
The **Tengu Liver** is a unique item dropped exclusively by the Tengu boss for Gnoll heroes. When consumed, it offers the Gnoll player a choice between two subclasses: Guardian or WitchDoctor.

==== Details ====
The Tengu Liver belongs to a mighty foe. Just by looking at it, your feral instincts take over, and you feel the urge to consume it. This item is unique in that it provides subclass advancement for the Gnoll hero class, offering a choice between their two mastery paths.

==== Mechanics ====
- When consumed, the Tengu Liver presents a choice between two subclasses:
  - **Guardian** (for Gnoll class): Skillful defensive knowledge allows the Guardian to counterattack with a shield, making him a formidable foe for those who dare to attack this walking bastion.
  - **Witchdoctor** (for Gnoll class): Spellcasting endows the Witchdoctor with a magic shield that completely protects him from incoming damage.
- Both Guardian and WitchDoctor are the official subclasses for the Gnoll hero class as defined in the game code
- Since the Tengu Liver is only obtainable by Gnoll players, it offers them their two class-appropriate mastery paths

==== Acquisition ====
- The Tengu Liver is dropped by the **Tengu** boss after defeat
- It only appears when playing as the **Gnoll** hero class
- For other hero classes, the Tengu drops a Tome of Mastery instead

==== Usage Strategy ====
The Tengu Liver is a unique advancement item that should be used strategically. Since it's only obtainable by Gnoll players and offers their two official subclass options:

- For **Gnoll** players: Both Guardian and WitchDoctor are valid choices that synergize well with the Gnoll's unique mechanics
  - **Guardian** enhances the Gnoll's defensive capabilities, allowing effective counterattacks with shields
  - **WitchDoctor** provides magical protection through mana shield mechanics
