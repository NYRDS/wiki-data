====== Tengu Liver ======
The tengu liver is dropped by the tengu when playing as the [[gnoll_hero|Gnoll]]. It can be eaten by the Gnoll to gain access to its subclasses.

Similar to [[The Soulbringer]] for the necromancer, and unlike the Tome of Mastery when the player gets access to the subclasses, it does not start with the Gnoll.
