The **Potion of Might** is a type of potion in [[rpd:remixed_dungeon|Remixed Dungeon]] that permanently increases the drinker's [[rpd:strength_attribute|strength]] and [[rpd:health|maximum health]].

==== Effects ====
When consumed, the Potion of Might provides:
  * +1 permanent [[rpd:strength_attribute|strength]] - [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/watabou/pixeldungeon/items/potions/PotionOfMight.java#L27|code reference]]
  * +5 permanent [[rpd:health|hit points]] (maximum health) - [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/watabou/pixeldungeon/items/potions/PotionOfMight.java#L28|code reference]]
  * Heals 5 HP immediately upon consumption - [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/watabou/pixeldungeon/items/potions/PotionOfMight.java#L29|code reference]]

==== Acquisition ====

  * [[rpd:chests|Chests]] in the dungeon
  * [[rpd:shops|Shops]] (rarely available)
  * As a rare drop from certain enemies
  * In [[rpd:treasury|Treasury]] levels

==== Strategy ====
  * Best consumed early in the game when additional strength is most beneficial
  * Provides a permanent boost to carrying capacity and melee damage
  * The extra health is immediately applied to current health, making it safe to consume even at low health
  * Only one Potion of Might exists per game, so timing its consumption is important
