====== Mob Speeds ======

==== Description ====
Mob speeds determine how quickly various enemies move and act in comparison to the player character.

==== Standard Speed ====
  * **Normal Speed** - Most mobs and the player move at 1× speed
  * **Turn-Based Movement** - Each move action takes the same amount of game time

==== Fast Mobs ====
  * **[[rpd:shadow_mob|Shadow]]** - Moves at 2× normal speed
  * **[[rpd:rat_mob|Rat]]** - Slightly faster than average
  * **[[rpd:gnoll_scout_mob|Gnoll Scout]]** - Fast melee attacker

==== Slow Mobs ====
  * **[[rpd:golem_mob|Golem]]** - Moves slower than average
  * [[rpd:stone_guardian_mob|Stone Guardian]] - Very slow movement
  * [[rpd:dm300_mob|DM-300]] - Deliberately slow but powerful

==== Speed Mechanics ====
  * **Action Economy** - Faster mobs get more actions in a given time period
  * **Escape Difficulty** - Fast mobs are harder to kite or escape from
  * **Combat Pacing** - Changes the rhythm of combat encounters
  * **Tactical Considerations** - Affects which enemies to prioritize

==== Strategy ====
  * **Kiting** - Only effective against mobs slower than you
  * **Positioning** - Critical against fast enemies to avoid being surrounded
  * **Resource Management** - Fast enemies require more resources to defeat
  * **Retreat Planning** - Consider escape routes when fighting fast enemies
  * **Speed Items** - Using speed-enhancing items can help against fast mobs

==== Effects on Speed ====
  * **[[rpd:slow_buff|Slow]]** - Reduces movement and action speed
  * **[[rpd:chill_buff|Chill]]** - Reduces speed (less severe than slow)
  * **[[rpd:elements#speed|Elemental Effects]]** - Some elements affect speed
  * **Buffs and Debuffs** - Various status effects can modify speed
