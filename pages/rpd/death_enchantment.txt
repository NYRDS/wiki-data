The **Death Enchantment** is a powerful enchantment for weapons in Remixed Dungeon that can instantly kill enemies under specific conditions.

==== Description ====
The Death enchantment has a chance to instantly kill any enemy when they are struck with the enchanted weapon. The chance depends on the health of the target enemy, with lower health enemies having a higher probability of being instantly killed.

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Instant Kill Chance:** The chance to instantly kill an enemy is calculated based on the enemy's remaining health percentage - the lower the health, the higher the chance
  * **Maximum Effectiveness:** Most effective against weakened enemies
  * **Resistance:** Some enemies (like the Warlock) have resistance to death-related effects

==== Affected Items ====
  * Can be applied to any weapon that supports enchantments

==== Acquisition ====
  * **Scroll of Upgrade:** Can appear on upgraded weapons
  * **Scroll of Enchantment:** Available as a possible enchantment through enchantment scrolls
  * **Shops:** May appear in shops on randomly generated enchanted weapons

==== Strategy ====
  * Most effective when fighting weakened enemies
  * Combines well with other damage-over-time effects to weaken enemies before delivering the final blow
  * Consider using when you encounter enemies that are already damaged
  * Be aware that some enemies have resistances to death effects
