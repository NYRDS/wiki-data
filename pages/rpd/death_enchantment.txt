{{ rpd:images:enchant_death.png|Death Enchantment }}

==== Description ====
The Death enchantment has a chance to instantly kill non-boss enemies when they are hit by the weapon. This is one of the most powerful enchantments but does not work on bosses.

==== Mechanics ====
- The chance to instantly kill an enemy is based on the weapon's level
- Only affects non-boss enemies (does not work on minibosses and bosses)
- Higher-level weapons have a higher chance to trigger
- Provides significant advantage against regular enemies
- Bosses and minibosses take extra damage instead of being killed

==== Source Code ====
- Java: [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/watabou/pixeldungeon/items/weapon/enchantments/Death.java|Death.java]]
- The effect is applied in the proc() method with probability increasing with weapon level
- Death immunity of bosses is checked via isImmune() method
