{{ rpd:images:crab_mob.png|Crab }}

The **Crab** is a common enemy found in the Sewers level of Remixed Dungeon. It has high defense but relatively low damage and HP, making it a tough but manageable opponent for early-game players.

==== Stats ====
  * **HP**: 15 (HT: 15)
  * **Defense Skill**: 5
  * **Attack Skill**: 12
  * **Damage**: 5-10
  * **EXP for Kill**: 4
  * **Maximum Level**: 7
  * **Armor**: 5 DR (Defense Rating)

==== Description ====
These crustaceans are the first challenging inhabitants of the dungeon's sewers. They move slowly but have thick shells that make them difficult to hit and damage. Their pincers are strong enough to crack bones, making them dangerous despite their small size.

==== Abilities ====
  * **High Defense**: Natural shell provides excellent protection against physical attacks
  * **Strong Pincers**: Can deliver powerful pinching attacks
  * **Slow Movement**: Moves at a reduced speed compared to most other creatures
  * **Tough Shell**: High armor rating makes it resistant to damage

==== Location ====
  * **Primary Location**: Sewers level (levels 1-3)
  * **Spawn Frequency**: Very common in Sewers area
  * **Group Behavior**: Usually found alone or in pairs
  * **Special Variants**: No special variants

==== Strategy ====
  * The Crab's high defense makes it hard to hit, so high-damage weapons work best
  * Magic attacks (like wands) can bypass its armor effect
  * Be patient - don't rush directly towards it as it can cause significant damage
  * It's best to engage from a distance or with weapons that have high accuracy
  * The Crab moves slowly, so it's good for practicing combat

==== Special Notes ====
  * One of the tougher enemies for new players in the Sewers
  * Can be more dangerous if it's at full health and you're low on health
  * Its armor rating can make regular attacks very ineffective
  * Useful for training if you are not in a hurry to progress
