**Alchemy** is the system in Remixed Dungeon that allows players to convert seeds into potions.

==== Description ====
Alchemy is a crafting system that uses alchemy pots found in various levels to convert seeds into potions. It requires 3 or more seeds of the same type to create a potion. The system is primarily used for converting excess seeds into useful potions.

==== Alchemy Pot Locations ====
  * Found in laboratory levels
  * Sometimes generated in special crafting areas
  * Not commonly found in regular dungeon levels

==== Alchemy Process ====
  * **Seed to Potion** - Place 3 or more seeds of the same type on an alchemy pot
  * When using 3 or more seeds, there is a base chance to create a random potion from the game's potion selection
  * If successful, there is an additional chance to generate the specific potion associated with the seed type (e.g., Firebloom seeds have a chance to create Potion of Liquid Flame)

  * Seed Class: [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/watabou/pixeldungeon/plants/Seed.java|Seed.java]]
  * Each seed type has an alchemyClass property that defines what potion it can potentially create (e.g., Firebloom seeds can create Potion of Liquid Flame)

==== Strategy ====
  * Convert excess seeds into useful potions to save inventory space
  * Prioritize seeds that create more valuable potions
  * Use alchemy when you have an abundance of one seed type

==== Tips ====
  * Always have 3 or more seeds of the same type to craft a potion
  * The chance to create the specific potion tied to the seed increases with more seeds used
  * If you don't have enough of one seed type, the result will be a random potion
  * Alchemy pots can be used to dispose of unwanted items (though not as efficiently as other methods)
