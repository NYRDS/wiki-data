====== Ballistica ======

Ballistica is the targeting and pathfinding system used in Remixed Dungeon for ranged attacks and other directional effects.

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Path Calculation:** Determines the path from source to target
  * **Line of Sight:** Used to determine if target is visible
  * **Obstacle Detection:** Identifies obstacles in the path
  * **Final Position:** Determines the actual impact point

==== Usage in Game ====
  * [[rpd:wands|Wands]] - For targeting with wands
  * [[rpd:kusarigama|Kusarigama]] - For the pull action
  * [[rpd:throwing_weapons|Throwing weapons]] - For trajectory calculations
  * [[rpd:spells|Spells]] - For directional spell effects
  * [[rpd:traps|Traps]] - For some trap effects that have direction

==== Technical Details ====
  * Uses raycasting for path determination
  * Accounts for walls and other obstacles
  * Can handle reflection off certain surfaces in advanced implementations
  * Critical for proper ranged combat mechanics

==== Strategy ====
  * Understanding line of sight can improve accuracy with ranged items
  * Positioning can block enemy ranged attacks using obstacles
  * Helpful to know for predicting enemy ranged attacks
