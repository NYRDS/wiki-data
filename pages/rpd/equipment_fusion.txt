====== Equipment Fusion ======

Equipment fusion is a special crafting mechanic that combines different equipment pieces to create unique items with powerful properties.

==== Fusion Process ====
Equipment fusion typically involves:
  * Using a special catalyst item (like [[rpd:chaos_crystal_item|Chaos Crystal]])
  * Combining with a base equipment item
  * Creating a new item with properties from both

==== Types of Fusion ====
  * **Chaos Fusion** - Uses chaos crystals to create chaotic equipment like [[rpd:chaos_sword_item|Chaos Sword]]
  * **Elemental Fusion** - Combines items with elemental properties
  * **Enchantment Fusion** - Merges enchantment properties from multiple items
  * **Stat Fusion** - Combines the statistical properties of equipment

==== Chaos Crystal Fusion ====
One of the most prominent fusion systems involves [[rpd:chaos_crystal_item|Chaos Crystal]]:

  * Requires a fully identified Chaos Crystal with 50+ charges
  * Can fuse with any melee weapon to create a [[rpd:chaos_sword_item|Chaos Sword]]
  * The resulting weapon takes on properties of the original weapon
  * Fusion results in unique mechanics with evolving power levels

==== Benefits of Fusion ====
  * Unique item properties not found elsewhere
  * Powerful synergistic effects
  * Customization of equipment for playstyle
  * Access to rare or limited mechanics

==== Challenges ====
  * Requires specific catalyst items
  * May result in unpredictable properties
  * Can consume valuable equipment
  * Resource intensive process

==== Strategy ====
  * Preserve valuable equipment if uncertain about fusion results
  * Research fusion recipes before committing equipment
  * Consider the benefits vs. keeping original equipment
  * Time fusion attempts strategically during your dungeon run
