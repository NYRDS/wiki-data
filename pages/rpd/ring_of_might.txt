{{ rpd:images:item_RingOfMight.png|Ring of Might }}

The **Ring of Might** is a ring in Remixed Dungeon that provides a constant strength bonus to the wearer.

==== Description ====
The Ring of Might incrementally increases the wearer's effective strength, allowing them to wear heavier armor and weapons. This is particularly useful for characters who have reached their natural strength limit but still need to equip powerful items that require more strength.

==== Effects ====
  * **Strength Bonus:** Provides a gradual increase to effective strength
  * **Rate of Growth:** Strength bonus increases slowly over time
  * **Cap:** Bonus is capped at a maximum amount (usually +3 to +4 strength)
  * **Permanent While Equipped:** Bonus remains as long as the ring is worn

==== Stats ====
  * **Effect Type:** Passive strength enhancement
  * **Upgradeable:** Can be upgraded with scrolls of upgrade
  * **Degradation:** Quality may decrease over time (with some variants)
  * **Rarity:** Rare (appears less frequently than other rings)

==== Strategy ====
  * **Early Game:** May not provide immediate benefit if strength requirement is already met
  * **Mid Game:** Useful for wearing armor/weapon upgrades that have high strength requirements
  * **Late Game:** Essential for using the most powerful equipment with high strength requirements
  * **Pairing:** Works well with other rings of utility

==== Acquisition ====
  * **Random Drops:** Found as random drops from mobs
  * **Chests:** May appear in various chests throughout the dungeon
  * **NPCs:** Sometimes sold by shopkeepers or other NPCs
  * **Upgrading:** Can be improved with scrolls of upgrade
