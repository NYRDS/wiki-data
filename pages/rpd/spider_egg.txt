  * **Seed Farming:** Has a 20% chance to drop a seed when destroyed, which might be useful
  * **Avoid Crowding:** Be careful not to let multiple eggs hatch near each other creating a spider swarm
  * **Spider Management:** Consider the spider population in the area when deciding whether to destroy or let hatch
