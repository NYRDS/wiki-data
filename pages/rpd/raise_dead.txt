====== Raise Dead ======

Raise Dead is a necromantic ability for the [[rpd:necromancer|Necromancer]] class that attempts to raise the most recently slain creature as an undead minion.

==== Description ====
Attempt to raise the latest slain creature (the ritual requires quite fresh material). When using this dark art, remember: almost any creature can be raised, but not everyone's will is easy to bend. This spell allows Necromancers to turn defeated enemies into loyal undead servants.

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Requirement:** Must have recently defeated a creature
  * **Freshness:** Works best on recently killed creatures
  * **Success Rate:** Depends on the target creature's will/resistance
  * **Minion Type:** Raised creature becomes a controllable undead minion

==== Usage ====
  * **Timing:** Must be used soon after defeating a creature
  * **Class Ability:** Exclusively for [[rpd:necromancer|Necromancer]] class
  * **Tactical:** Can turn powerful enemies into allies
  * **Resource:** Makes use of defeated enemies instead of leaving them

==== Strategy ====
  * Best used after defeating strong enemies for powerful minions
  * Consider which enemies would make better allies than adversaries
  * Timing is crucial - use immediately after killing desired target
  * Higher success rate with weaker-willed creatures
  * Can be used to create a large army of undead followers

==== Limitations ====
  * **Space:** Requires available space near the player
  * **Timing:** Must be used quickly after kill
  * **Success Chance:** Not guaranteed to work on every creature
  * **Range:** Must be used near the corpse

==== Considerations ====

  * **Risk vs Reward:** Consider whether to use on strong enemy or save for better one
