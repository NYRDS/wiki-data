The Stranger, also known as Azuterron, is a mysterious figure shrouded in black mist who offers a quest to adventurers in the dungeon.

==== Description ====
A mysterious figure shrouded by black mist. The Stranger appears as a quest-giver with unique dialogue and a special quest related to defeating a dark creature.

==== Quest ====
  * **Objective:** Defeat the [[rpd:treacherous_spirit|Treacherous Spirit]] and bring back its [[rpd:heart_of_darkness|Heart of Darkness]]
  * **Offer:** In exchange for help, the Stranger offers assistance and a potion as reward
  * **Alternative:** [[rpd:necromancer|Necromancers]] have the option to dominate the spirit instead of slaying it

==== Dialogue ====
The Stranger's opening speech: "Huh, why... oh, you see me, don't you? That means you're not one of \"them\". I see you're not fond of all these monsters as well. Tell you what, if you'll help me out with a little problem, then I will offer you my assistance. Somewhere on this level you will find a beast of darkness, a [[rpd:treacherous_spirit|Treacherous Spirit]]. Slay it, take it's [[rpd:heart_of_darkness|heart]] and come back to me. And one more thing, if you are interested in purchasing my supplies, don't hesitate to ask"
