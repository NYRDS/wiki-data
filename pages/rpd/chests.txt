====== Chests ======

Chests are containers that hold treasure in Remixed Dungeon. They are found throughout the dungeon levels and contain valuable items.

==== Types of Chests ====
  * **Regular Chests**: Standard containers with typical treasure
  * **Crystal Chests**: [[rpd:crystal_merchant|Crystal Merchant]] exclusive containers with high-value items
  * **Locked Chests**: Require a key to open, contain better treasure
  * **Coffins**: Special containers that are more common in Necropolis

==== Treasure Types ====
Chests may contain:
  * [[rpd:gold_item|Gold]]
  * [[rpd:potion_item|Potions]]
  * [[rpd:scroll_item|Scrolls]]
  * [[rpd:weapon_item|Weapons]]
  * [[rpd:armor_item|Armor]]
  * [[rpd:ring_item|Rings]]
  * [[rpd:artifacts|Artifacts]]
  * [[rpd:food|Food]]

==== Special Chest Mechanics ====
  * Chests can be trapped with various [[rpd:traps|traps]]
  * [[rpd:ring_of_wealth|Ring of Wealth]] increases the quality of chest contents
  * Locked chests require corresponding [[rpd:keys_and_locks|keys]] to open
  * Some rare items are only found in chests

==== Strategy ====
  * Always be cautious when opening chests - they may be trapped
  * Use [[rpd:ring_of_awareness|Ring of Awareness]] to detect traps before opening
  * Crystal chests are guaranteed to be trap-free and contain better items
  * Locked chests provide better rewards but require keys to open
