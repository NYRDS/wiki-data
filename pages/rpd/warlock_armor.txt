====== Warlock Armor ======

Warlock Armor is the class-specific armor exclusive to the Warlock subclass in Remixed Dungeon, which is a subclass of the Mage class.

==== Acquisition ====
  * Use an Armor Kit on any regular armor while playing as a Mage who has chosen the Warlock subclass
  * Transforms the base armor into Warlock Armor with special properties
  * Note: This armor is only available for the Warlock subclass and cannot be equipped by other classes or subclasses

==== Special Properties ====
  * Inherits all properties of Mage Armor (Blast ability)
  * Blast ability: Ignites and roots all visible enemies for 3 turns
  * Requires sufficient skill points to use special ability
  * Exclusive to the Warlock subclass - cannot be equipped if not the Warlock subclass (will show warning message)

==== Usage ====
  * Essential armor for maximizing the effectiveness of the Warlock subclass
  * Should be crafted as soon as possible after choosing the Warlock subclass
  * Allows full utilization of subclass abilities

==== Special Ability: Blast ====
  * Ignites and roots all visible enemies for 3 turns
  * Requires skill points to activate
  * Area-effect ability that affects all enemies in line of sight
  * Provides both damage over time (burning) and control (rooting)

==== Notes ====
  * Part of the subclass identity system in Remixed Dungeon
  * Class armors represent the unique nature of each subclass
  * Cannot be worn by characters who haven't unlocked the appropriate subclass
  * Inherits the base Mage armor special ability
