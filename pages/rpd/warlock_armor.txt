====== Warlock Armor ======

Warlock Armor is the class-specific armor obtained by using an [[rpd:armor_kit_item|Armor Kit]] on any regular armor for the [[rpd:warlock_subclass|Warlock]] subclass in Remixed Dungeon. This armor is functionally identical to [[rpd:battle_mage_armor_item|Battle Mage Armor]], but has a different appearance.

==== Acquisition ====
  * Use an [[rpd:armor_kit_item|Armor Kit]] on any regular armor while playing as a [[rpd:mage_class|Mage]] who has chosen the [[rpd:warlock_subclass|Warlock]] subclass
  * Transforms the base armor into Warlock Armor with special properties
  * Note: This armor is only available for the Warlock subclass and cannot be equipped by other classes or subclasses

==== Special Properties ====
  * Inherits all properties of [[rpd:mage_armor_item|Mage Armor]] (Blast ability)
  * Blast ability: Ignites and roots all visible enemies for 3 turns
  * Requires sufficient skill points to use special ability
  * Exclusive to the [[rpd:warlock_subclass|Warlock]] subclass - cannot be equipped if not the [[rpd:warlock_subclass|Warlock]] subclass (will show warning message)

==== Usage ====
  * Essential armor for maximizing the effectiveness of the [[rpd:warlock_subclass|Warlock]] subclass
  * Should be crafted as soon as possible after choosing the [[rpd:warlock_subclass|Warlock]] subclass
  * Allows full utilization of subclass abilities

==== Special Ability: Blast ====
  * Ignites and roots all visible enemies for 3 turns
  * Requires skill points to activate
  * Area-effect ability that affects all enemies in line of sight
  * Provides both damage over time (burning) and control (rooting)

==== Notes ====
  * Part of the subclass identity system in Remixed Dungeon
  * Class armors represent the unique nature of each subclass
  * Cannot be worn by characters who haven't unlocked the appropriate subclass
  * Functionally identical to [[rpd:battle_mage_armor_item|Battle Mage Armor]] with only visual differences
  * Inherits the base [[rpd:mage_armor_item|Mage armor]] special ability
