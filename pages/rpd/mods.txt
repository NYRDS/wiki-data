====== Modding ======

=====How-to install custom mod =====

Mods are typically packed in zip archives (sometime file extension changed to something like zipp if this is the case rename it to plain zip)

To install mod on Remixed Dungeon manually:

Android version >= 11 (requires remixed 32.1+)

option 1 (If you delevoping mod):
  * unpack mod archive to any directory under Downloads folder
  * In game Mod -> Install local mod -> pick mod directory (refer to [[https://www.youtube.com/shorts/hJq-7vVaf4o|video]] if in doubt)

option 2 (To install mod developed by someone else):
  * place mod archive in rpd format on device
  * navigate to it in file manager (refer to [[https://www.youtube.com/shorts/wyPVbAdbWXQ|video]] if in doubt)
  * tap to open
  * choose Remixed Dungeon app
  * In app: confirm mod installation

Android version < 11

  * unpack mod archive to **Android/data/com.nyrds.pixeldungeon.ml/files/**
  * done.

=====How-to create custom mod =====

In order to be able to play your mod (or any other non-official mod), you need to place your modified files in a folder named the way you want your mod to be named (example: "My mod"). 

Don't forget to add at least minimal [[version.json]] file with something like {"version":1} as content.

Place that folder into the ”files” directory of the game. 

Approximate path on typical android system looks like this: 

**Android/data/com.nyrds.pixeldungeon.ml/files/** . 


=====  Basic Idea =====
  * Every PD flavors source has assets folder [[https://github.com/watabou/pixel-dungeon/tree/master/assets|vanilla for example]]
  * Remixed can load game resources not only from apk assets but also from external storage ( typically located at  Android/data/com.nyrds.pixeldungeon.ml/files/ ), so mods can override some (or all) of its content (also it must contain version.json file)
  * In Remixed [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/tree/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/assets|assets]] contains not only graphics & music but also data such as Dungeon structure, levels description, animation sequences and so on.

Each mod is resource overlay, that is they replace game assets such as textures, sounds, json configuration files and lua scripts while leaving java code intact.

The simplest way to get a better view at Remixed is to download one of the bundled mods and examine its structure. [[https://github.com/NYRDS/Maze-RPD-MOD|Maze]] is good to start from.

=====  Brief features list =====

Maybe it's worth for you to check Remixed PD mods mechanics. It is far from complete, completely lacks documentation, full of bugs, etc. But at this point, it allows to do the following (without touching the java code):

By just overriding resources you can:

  * Replace any sprite, sound or music

Using json configuration files you can:

  * Replace any text for any language already in
  * Assign file & index for item sprites
  * Change animation sequences for mobs ( not all special effects implemented yet )
  * Change dungeon structure ( levels graph, kind, size )
  * Assign custom level music
  * Assign custom music for boss fight
  * Add predesigned levels to dungeon ( you can use [[Tiled]] to define floor layout, place mobs and items)
  * Add random levels ( this feature somewhat similar to YourPD custom maps but no gui available yet )
  * Create custom bestiary ( mob|level probability )
  * Add signs and codexes with arbitrary texts

With some lua scripts you can:

  * Create custom traps
  * Create custom level actors
  * Create custom mobs with unique abilities
  * Create custom spells
  * Create custom items
  * Create custom buffs
  * Create custom AI for mobs and NPC's


You can check how other mods are structured, to get a better idea.
