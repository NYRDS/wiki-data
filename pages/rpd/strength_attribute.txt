====== Strength Attribute ======

The **Strength** attribute in Remixed Dungeon determines a character's physical power and ability to effectively use various equipment.

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Equipment Usage**: Determines whether a character can effectively use weapons and armor
  * **Carrying Capacity**: Higher strength allows carrying more items
  * **Melee Damage**: Strength directly impacts the damage dealt in melee combat
  * **Breaking Items**: Required strength to use certain items effectively

==== Strength Requirements ====
  * **Weapons**: Each weapon has a minimum strength requirement
  * **Armor**: Heavier armor often requires more strength to use effectively
  * **Penalty**: Using equipment above your strength capacity applies penalties

==== Improving Strength ====
  * **Potion of Might**: Permanently increases the hero's strength by 1-2 points
  * **Training**: Some classes or subclasses may have unique strength-boosting mechanics
  * **Equipment**: Some items may temporarily or permanently boost strength

==== Equipment Strength Calculations ====
  * **Effective Strength**: Your actual strength minus any penalties
  * **Strength Bonus**: Additional strength provided by items or buffs
  * **Required vs. Actual**: How your strength compares to equipment requirements
