**Rotten Meat** is a food item in Remixed Dungeon that results from Mystery Meat that has spoiled. Unlike its original form, consuming Rotten Meat has harmful effects.

==== Description ====
Rotten Meat is spoiled Mystery Meat that has become unsafe to consume. Unlike [[rpd:mystery_meat_item|Mystery Meat]], which has random effects, Rotten Meat reliably produces negative effects when consumed.

==== Class in Code ====

  * **Type:** Food item
  * **Stackable:** Yes
  * **Nutrition:** Minimal satiety but with negative effects

==== Effects When Consumed ====
  * Displays message: "Disgusting!"
  * Randomly creates hazardous gas clouds at the player's location:
    * Confusion Gas: 25% chance (150 + 10 * dungeon depth potency)
    * Paralytic Gas: 25% chance (500 potency)
    * Toxic Gas: 25% chance (500 potency)
    * No effect: 25% chance

==== Obtaining ====
  * **Spoilage:** Mystery Meat can become Rotten Meat if left uneaten for too long
  * **Natural occurrence:** May occasionally appear as dungeon loot (rare)

==== Purification ====
  * When purified using [[rpd:potion_of_purity_item|Potion of Purity]], transforms back into [[rpd:mystery_meat_item|Mystery Meat]]

==== Strategy ====
  * **Avoid consumption:** Never eat Rotten Meat due to the harmful gas effects
  * **Purification:** Purify with [[rpd:potion_of_purity_item|Potion of Purity]] to get back Mystery Meat
  * **Strategic placement:** Can be thrown at enemies to create gas clouds in combat
  * **Safe alternative:** Always cook [[rpd:mystery_meat_item|Mystery Meat]] to get [[rpd:chargrilled_meat_item|Chargrilled Meat]] instead of risking it becoming rotten
