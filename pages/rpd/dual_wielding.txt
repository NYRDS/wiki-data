====== Dual Wielding ======

**Dual Wielding** is a combat system introduced in Remixed Pixel Dungeon that allows players to equip weapons in both hands, increasing their attack frequency.

==== Overview ====
Dual Wielding was introduced in update 29.4.fix.8, allowing players to equip weapons in both the main hand and off-hand (left hand) slots for increased combat effectiveness.

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Slots**: Uses both the main weapon slot and the left hand slot
  * **Attack Speed**: Increases the frequency of attacks
  * **Weapon Requirements**: Generally works with one-handed weapons in both slots
  * **Strategy**: Focuses on offensive output over defensive capabilities

==== Equipment Requirements ====
To dual wield effectively:
  * Two compatible one-handed weapons
  * Free left hand slot (cannot dual wield if using a shield or two-handed weapon in main hand)
  * Sufficient strength to wield both weapons effectively

==== Combat Strategy ====
Dual wielding changes the combat approach to be more aggressive:

  * **Offense**: Higher damage output due to increased attack frequency
  * **Defense**: Reduced defensive capabilities compared to using a shield
  * **Versatility**: More attacks per turn but potentially less damage per hit
  * **Tactics**: Best for aggressive playstyles and when confident in defeating enemies quickly

==== Weapon Compatibility ====
Not all weapons can be dual wielded:
  * One-handed weapons generally work best for dual wielding
  * Two-handed weapons cannot be used with another weapon simultaneously
  * Some special weapons may have unique compatibility rules

==== Comparison with Other Options ====
  * **Dual Wielding vs. Shield**: More offensive but less defensive
  * **Dual Wielding vs. Two-handed**: More frequent but potentially weaker attacks
  * **Strategic Choice**: Player must decide between offense and defense based on situation
