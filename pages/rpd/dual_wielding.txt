====== Dual Wielding ======

**Dual Wielding** is a combat system in Remixed Pixel Dungeon that allows players to equip weapons in both the main hand and off-hand (left hand) slots.

==== Overview ====
The game features a left hand slot (Belongings.Slot.LEFT_HAND) that allows players to equip a second weapon for dual wielding, though it's not specifically labeled as "dual wielding" in the game code.

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Slots**: Uses both the main weapon slot and the left hand slot
  * **Combat**: Each equipped weapon can be used in combat, but the game doesn't have a special dual wielding attack system
  * **Weapon Requirements**: Generally works with weapons that can be equipped in the left hand slot
  * **Strategy**: Increases offensive potential but reduces defensive options

==== Equipment Requirements ====
To use both weapon slots:
  * Weapons that can be equipped in the left hand slot (not all weapons can be)
  * Free left hand slot (cannot dual wield if using a shield or two-handed weapon in main hand)
  * Sufficient strength to wield both weapons effectively

==== Combat Strategy ====
Using both weapon slots changes the combat approach:

  * **Offense**: Higher potential damage output by having more weapons available
  * **Defense**: Reduced defensive capabilities compared to using a shield
  * **Versatility**: Ability to switch between different weapon types quickly
  * **Tactics**: Allows carrying multiple weapon types for different situations

==== Weapon Compatibility ====
Not all weapons can be equipped in the left hand slot:
  * Many one-handed weapons can be equipped in the left hand slot
  * Two-handed weapons like [[rpd:war_hammer_item|War Hammer]], [[rpd:quarterstaff_item|Quarterstaff]], [[rpd:long_sword_item|Long Sword]], [[rpd:battle_axe_item|Battle Axe]], [[rpd:polearm_item|Polearm]], and [[rpd:claymore_item|Claymore]] cannot be used together with another weapon in the left hand
  * Bows (KindOfBow) are designed to use the left hand slot
  * Wands also use the left hand slot
  * The left hand slot is a general secondary equipment slot, not specifically for dual wielding
