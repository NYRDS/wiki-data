==== Description ====
Shielded enemies are Brutes that have been equipped with shields, giving them enhanced defensive capabilities compared to regular Brutes. They represent enemies that have adapted to dungeon combat with better protection.

==== Stats ====
* HP: High
* Defense: Very High (due to shield)
* Attack: Moderate to High
* Speed: Moderate
* Special: High damage resistance due to shield

==== Tactics ====
Shielded enemies require different tactics than regular Brutes:
  * They have significantly higher damage reduction due to their shield
  * Focus attacks that can bypass or break through the shield
  * Area-of-effect attacks can be more effective than single-target attacks
  * Ranged attacks can help engage from a safe distance

==== Strategy ====
Fighting Shielded enemies is particularly challenging due to their high defense. Consider using:
  * High-damage weapons to overcome their shielded defense
  * Piercing or special effect attacks
  * Magical attacks if their shield only protects against physical damage
  * Strategic positioning to avoid being surrounded
