====== Blank Scroll ======
Blank scrolls - Wellâ€¦ it's just a blank scroll which can be found anywhere (especially in Library rooms).

They are not useless as as it might seem at first glance, because they can be converted to a random scroll if you draw a rune on them by using the [[rpd:arcane stylus|Arcane Stylus]].

This item is unique for [[rpd:start|Remixed Pixel Dungeon]]

====== Notes ======
  * The [[rpd:arcane stylus|Arcane Stylus]] will not be destroyed when used on the blank scroll
