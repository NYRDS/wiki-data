====== Blank Scroll ======

{{tag> rpd items}}

==== Description ====
Blank scrolls are just blank pieces of parchment that can be found anywhere in the dungeon (especially in Library rooms). They are not useless as they might seem at first glance, because they can be converted to a random scroll if you draw a rune on them by using the [[rpd:arcane_stylus|Arcane Stylus]].

==== Properties ====
  * **Stackable:** Yes
  * **Unique:** This item is unique for Remixed Pixel Dungeon
  * **Class Restriction:** Can be used by all hero classes

==== Function ====
  * **Inscription:** Can be inscribed with magical properties using an [[rpd:arcane_stylus|Arcane Stylus]]
  * **Transformation:** When inscribed, becomes a random scroll from the available scroll types
  * **Supply Replenishment:** Provides a way to create useful scrolls when no other scrolls are available

==== Usage ====
To use a Blank Scroll, you need an [[rpd:arcane_stylus|Arcane Stylus]] to inscribe it. The resulting scroll will be randomly selected from the possible scroll types available in the current game state. The Arcane Stylus will not be destroyed when used on the blank scroll.

==== Strategy ====
  * Blank Scrolls are valuable items that can be transformed into useful scrolls using an Arcane Stylus
  * They provide a way to replenish scroll supplies when the dungeon's usual scroll generation is insufficient
  * Best used when you're low on scrolls but have an Arcane Stylus available
  * Since the resulting scroll is random, it's a good way to obtain scrolls you might not have found otherwise

==== Obtaining ====
Blank Scrolls can be found:
  * As random drops throughout the dungeon
  * Especially common in Library rooms
  * In various treasure locations
