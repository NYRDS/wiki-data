====== Leveling ======

Leveling is how the hero increases in power by gaining experience in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Description ====
Leveling is the progression system by which the hero becomes stronger through gaining experience points by defeating enemies and completing various dungeon challenges. Each level gained provides increased health and occasionally additional skills or abilities.

==== Leveling Mechanics ====
  * **Experience Gain**: Defeating enemies grants experience points
  * **Level Thresholds**: Each level requires a specific amount of experience
  * **Health Increase**: Each level increases maximum health by a certain amount
  * **Milestone Rewards**: Every few levels may provide additional benefits

==== Benefits of Leveling ====
  * **Increased Health**: Each level increases the hero's maximum health pool
  * **Improved Stats**: Higher levels make the hero more resilient and effective
  * **Progress Tracking**: Leveling provides a clear sense of advancement through the dungeon

==== Experience Sources ====
  * **Mobs**: Defeating enemies provides the primary source of experience
  * **Quests**: Completing special quests grants experience rewards
  * **Challenges**: Some special dungeon achievements provide experience
  * **Items**: Rarely, special items may grant experience

==== Leveling Strategy ====
  * **Safe Progression**: Don't take unnecessary risks before leveling up
  * **Health Management**: Ensure adequate health before attempting difficult enemies
  * **Resource Planning**: Leveling requires resources for healing between fights
  * **Timing**: Sometimes it's worth seeking additional experience before advancing levels
