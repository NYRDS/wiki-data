==== Stats ====
  * **Rarity**: Rare (only created by poisoning regular Rations)

  * **Price**: Cannot be purchased or sold

==== Description ====
Rotten Ration is a spoiled version of the standard Ration. It can only be created when a regular Ration becomes poisoned in harmful environmental conditions. While it provides some nutrition (60 energy), it also causes negative side effects when consumed.

==== Usage ====
  * Provides 60 energy units for hunger restoration
  * When consumed, causes random harmful gas effects (Confusion, Paralytic, or Toxic gas)
  * Takes 3 turns to consume (same as other food items)
  * Can be eaten for some nutritional benefit despite negative effects

==== Special Properties ====
  * Created only by poisoning regular [[rpd:ration_item|Rations]]
  * Provides 60 energy units when consumed (though with side effects)
  * Cannot be found naturally in treasure drops (0 probability in Treasury system)
  * Can be purified back to a normal [[rpd:ration_item|Ration]]
  * When thrown on ground, may cause gas effects before disappearing or remaining on ground

==== Acquisition ====
  * Created by environmental poisoning of regular Rations
  * Cannot be found naturally in dungeon
  * Cannot be purchased in shops

==== Strategy ====
