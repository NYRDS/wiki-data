==== Mechanics ====
The Haste spell implements the following mechanics:
  * When cast, the spell reduces the time spent on the next action by ''caster:skillLevel()/2'' (where skillLevel is the caster's skill level)
  * This means the hero's next action takes fewer turns to complete
  * The effect is temporary and only applies to one action

==== Usage ====
The Haste spell is most effective when:
  * Preparing for a high-cost action (like drinking a potion during combat)
  * Needing to quickly execute critical actions
  * Timing important moves during boss fights

==== Classes ====
Classes that can use this spell include:
  * Classes with [[rpd:rogue_class|Rogue]] affinity (e.g., [[rpd:rogue_class|Rogue class]])
  * Other classes that gain access through special means

==== Strategy ====
How to effectively use the Haste spell:
  * Use before high-turn-cost actions (like drinking potions or eating food during combat)
  * Plan your next action carefully after casting, as the effect only applies to one action
  * Consider using when you're under heavy pressure and need to execute something quickly
