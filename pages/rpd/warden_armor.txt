  * Transforms the base armor into Warden Armor with special properties

==== Special Properties ====
  * **Exclusive to Warden**: Can only be equipped by characters with the Warden subclass
  * **Spectral Blades**: Inherited from Huntress Armor - creates multiple spectral blades that attack all visible enemies
  * **Visual Design**: Features a distinctive hooded appearance that covers the hair

==== Special Ability: Spectral Blades ====
  * **Action**: WARDEN_ARMOR_ACSPECIAL
  * **Effect**: Creates spectral blades that simultaneously attack all visible enemies on the level
  * **Mechanics**: Works similar to throwing multiple shurikens at once
  * **Strategic Use**: Best used when surrounded by multiple enemies

==== Stats ====
  * **Class**: Armor
  * **Subclass**: Huntress Armor (inherits properties)
  * **Requirements**: [[rpd:warden|Warden]] subclass to equip
  * **Visual**: Has helmet that covers hair

==== Usage ====
  * Essential armor for maximizing the effectiveness of the [[rpd:warden|Warden]] subclass
  * Should be crafted as soon as possible after choosing the [[rpd:warden|Warden]] subclass
