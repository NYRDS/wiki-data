{{ rpd:images:item_AmokArrow.png|Amok Arrow }}

**Amok Arrow** is a special ranged ammunition item in Remixed Pixel Dungeon that causes enemies to attack each other.

==== Description ====
A wooden arrow with a head soaked in chaotic material. When this arrow hits an enemy, it applies an Amok effect that causes the target to attack other creatures randomly instead of the hero. This is created by "moistening" a Common Arrow with a Potion of Strength.

==== Stats ====
  * **Damage:** 1-3 points
  * **Delay:** 1.0x (relative to weapon firing speed)
  * **Durability:** Single use (consumed on impact)
  * **Price:** Cannot be purchased in shops; only created through moistening
  * **Weight:** 1

==== Properties ====
  * **Type:** Throwing/Ammunition (Special)
  * **Usage:** For use with ranged weapons like bows
  * **Consumable:** Each arrow is consumed after being shot
  * **Stackable:** Can stack up to very high quantities
  * **Special Effect:** Causes the target to go into Amok state, attacking other creatures

==== Creation ====
Amok Arrows can be created by using a [[rpd:potion_of_strength|Potion of Strength]] on regular [[rpd:common_arrow|Common Arrows]]. This process is called "moistening" and transforms the basic arrow into one with special properties.

==== Mechanics ====
  * When hitting an enemy, applies the Amok status effect for 20 turns
  * Also applies Speed buff for 20 turns and creates a RageBuff (which causes the target to go into Amok state)
  * Amok causes the target to lose loyalty and attack other creatures randomly
  * Amok'd creatures will target other nearby creatures (including allies and other enemies)
  * The effect lasts for a limited duration before the creature returns to normal
  * Does not stack with other status effects like Charm or Terror

==== Availability ====
  * **Creation Only:** Cannot be found as random loot; must be created by moistening
  * **Required Materials:** Common Arrow + Potion of Strength
  * **Alchemy:** Part of the game's alchemy system for creating special ammunition

==== Strategy ====
  * Excellent for turning groups of enemies against each other
  * Can be used to redirect dangerous enemies' attention away from the hero
  * Particularly effective in areas with multiple enemy types
  * Good for creating chaos in groups of enemies, potentially eliminating some
  * Useful when facing powerful enemies with weaker allies
