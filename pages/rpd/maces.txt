{{ rpd:images:mace_item.png|Mace }}

Maces are a type of [[rpd:melee_weapon|melee weapon]] in Remixed Dungeon that specialize in dealing consistent damage and are effective against armored foes.

==== Description ====
Maces are blunt weapons that rely on sheer impact force rather than sharp edges. They are particularly effective against enemies with armor, as their crushing attacks often ignore or reduce the effects of armor protection.

==== Weapon Properties ====
  * **Damage Type:** Crushing damage that can ignore armor
  * **Speed:** Generally slower than light weapons but faster than heavy weapons
  * **Accuracy:** Average to good accuracy
  * **Upgrade Potential:** Can be upgraded with [[rpd:scroll_of_upgrade_item|Scrolls of Upgrade]]
  * **Enchantments:** Compatible with [[rpd:weapon_enchantments|weapon enchantments]]

==== Available Maces ====
  * [[rpd:mace_item|Mace]] - Basic mace weapon
  * **War Hammer** - Heavier mace variant (to be detailed)

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Armor Piercing:** Maces often ignore a percentage of enemy armor
  * **Stunning:** Some maces have a chance to stun enemies on hit
  * **Consistent Damage:** Generally provide reliable damage output
