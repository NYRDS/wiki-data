====== Poison Buff ======

{{ rpd:images:poison_buff.png|Poison Buff }}

The **Poison** buff is a negative status effect in Remixed Dungeon that causes continuous damage over time.

==== Description ====
Poison is a harmful debuff that causes damage each turn, with the damage increasing the longer the effect persists. The damage dealt increases as the duration decreases, making it more dangerous the longer it stays active.

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Damage Calculation:** Deals (timeLeft / 3) + 1 damage each turn (where timeLeft is the remaining duration)
  * **Visual Effect:** Shows "Poisoned" status message in red text and emits poison particles
  * **Icon:** Specific icon in the buff bar (BuffIndicator.POISON)
  * **Duration:** Variable depending on source, but damage increases over time
  * **Death Effect:** If poison kills the hero, it triggers a "Death from Poison" failure condition
