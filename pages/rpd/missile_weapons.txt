====== Missile Weapons ======

==== Description ====
Missile weapons are a category of weapons in Remixed Pixel Dungeon that can be thrown at enemies. Unlike regular thrown items, missile weapons have specific stats and can be upgraded like other weapons.

==== Types ====
  * [[rpd:boomerang|Boomerang]] - Returns to the player after being thrown
  * [[rpd:common_arrow|Arrows]] - Ammunition for ranged weapons
  * [[rpd:javelin|Javelin]] - Thrown spear
  * [[rpd:dart|Dart]] - Basic throwing projectile
  * [[rpd:shuriken|Shuriken]] - Ninja throwing stars

==== Mechanics ====
  * Missile weapons can be aimed at enemies to deal damage
  * Thrown weapons use the player's accuracy stat to determine if they hit
  * Most missile weapons have durability and will be lost after use (except for the boomerang)
  * Missile weapons can benefit from accuracy bonuses like rings of accuracy
  * Some missile weapons can be enchanted like regular weapons

==== Upgradable Missile Weapons ====
  * [[rpd:boomerang|Boomerang]] is the only missile weapon that can be upgraded
  * Each upgrade increases its damage range (MIN += 1, MAX += 2)

==== Throwing Speed ====
  * Different missile weapons have different throwing speeds
  * Throwing speed affects how quickly the weapon travels to the target
  * Speed values are defined in the weapon's DLY (delay) stat

==== Special Properties ====
  * The **Boomerang** has the unique property of returning to the player after being thrown
  * **Arrows** must be used with compatible ranged weapons like bows
  * Some missile weapons have special effects when they hit
