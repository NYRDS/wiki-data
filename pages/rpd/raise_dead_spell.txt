**Raise Dead** is a spell in Remixed Pixel Dungeon (Necromancy Affinity) that attempts to raise the most recently slain creature as an undead minion.

==== Description ====
Attempt to raise the latest (Ritual requires quite a fresh material) slain creature. When using this dark art, remember: almost any creature can be raised, but not everyone's will is easy to bend. This spell allows Necromancers to turn defeated enemies into loyal undead servants.

  * **Magic Affinity:** Necromancy
  * **Targeting:** none
  * **Level:** 4
  * **Mana Cost:** 15
  * **Cast Time:** 3 turns
  * **Effect:** Summons recently killed creature as pet undead

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Requirement:** Must have recently defeated a creature
  * **Freshness:** Works best on recently killed creatures (uses storage to track latest kill)
  * **Success Rate:** Raises creature successfully if space is available
  * **Minion Type:** Raised creature becomes a controllable undead minion
  * **Implementation:** Uses ''storage.get("__latest_dead_mob")'' to find last killed creature

  * **Class Ability:** Primarily for [[rpd:necromancer|Necromancer]] class with Necromancy affinity
  * **Tactical:** Can turn powerful enemies into allies

  * **Space Requirement:** Needs available space near player to summon
  * Bringing back a recently killed powerful enemy as an ally
