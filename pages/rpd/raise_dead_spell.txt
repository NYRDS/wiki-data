**Raise Dead** is a Necromancy Affinity spell in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Description ====
Attempt to raise the latest (ritual requires quite a fresh material) slain creature. When using this dark art, remember: almost any creature can be raised, but not everyone's will is easy to bend. The spell raises the most recently killed creature as a pet under your control.

==== Stats ====
  * **Magic Affinity:** Necromancy
  * **Targeting:** None (targets the latest killed creature)
  * **Level:** 4
  * **Mana Cost:** 15
  * **Cast Time:** 3 turns
  * **Special Effects:** Summons the latest killed mob as a pet

==== Mechanics ====
When cast, Raise Dead attempts to resurrect the most recently killed creature:
  * Only creatures that can be pets (except Mirror Images) can be raised
  * The creature's original class and stats are preserved
  * The raised creature becomes a pet under the caster's control
  * The raised creature is set as an undead (using setUndead(true))
  * The raised creature is given a gold item as loot
  * All existing items are removed from the raised creature (using removeAllItems)
  * Visual effect: Shadow particle burst (CURSE) on both caster and mob sprites
  * Audio effect: Cursed sound when cast successfully

==== Usage ====
The Raise Dead spell can be used for:
  * Bringing back a recently killed powerful enemy as an ally
  * Converting dangerous creatures into helpful pets
  * Strategic advantage in dungeon exploration with additional help

==== Classes ====
Classes with Necromancy magic affinity can use this spell more efficiently.

==== Strategy ====
How to effectively use the Raise Dead spell:
  * Prepare to kill a useful creature that can be made into a pet
  * Use immediately after killing a strong enemy you want as an ally
  * Consider the space constraints, as the spell fails if there's no free space
  * Be aware that only the most recently killed creature can be raised
  * Note that Mirror Images cannot be raised
  * The raised creature retains the original's abilities but serves as your pet

==== Restrictions ====
  * Only works on the most recently killed creature that can be a pet
  * Fails if there's no valid space to spawn the creature
  * Cannot raise creatures if no valid creatures have been killed yet
  * Mirror Images cannot be raised
  * Any items the original mob had are removed from the raised pet
