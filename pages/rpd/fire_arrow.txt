{{ rpd:images:item_FireArrow.png|Fire Arrow }}

**Fire Arrow** is a special ranged ammunition item in Remixed Pixel Dungeon that ignites enemies on hit.

==== Description ====
A wooden arrow with a head soaked in flammable material. When this arrow hits an enemy, it ignites the target. According to the string resources, "This arrow looks just like a normal one, other than a warm red light radiating from its head."

==== Stats ====
  * **Damage:** 1-6 points (base damage before bow modifiers)
  * **Delay:** 0.75x (relative to weapon firing speed)
  * **Durability:** Single use (consumed on impact)
  * **Price:** Cannot be purchased in shops; only created through moistening
  * **Weight:** 1

==== Properties ====
  * **Type:** Throwing/Ammunition (Special)
  * **Usage:** For use with ranged weapons like bows
  * **Consumable:** Each arrow is consumed after being shot
  * **Stackable:** Can stack up to very high quantities
  * **Special Effect:** Ignites the target on hit or lights terrain fires

==== Creation ====
Fire Arrows can be created by using a [[rpd:potion_of_liquid_flame|Potion of Liquid Flame]] on regular [[rpd:common_arrow|Common Arrows]]. This process is called "moistening" and transforms the basic arrow into one with special properties.

==== Mechanics ====
  * When hitting an enemy, applies the Burning status effect
  * Burning causes 1 damage per turn until extinguished or enemy dies
  * Can ignite flammable terrain like grass when fired into it
  * Burning enemies take damage and can set adjacent flammable terrain on fire
  * Does not stack with other status effects like Poison or Paralysis

==== Availability ====
  * **Creation Only:** Cannot be found as random loot; must be created by moistening
  * **Required Materials:** Common Arrow + Potion of Liquid Flame
  * **Alchemy:** Part of the game's alchemy system for creating special ammunition

==== Strategy ====
  * Excellent for dealing sustained damage to groups of enemies
  * Can be used to create environmental advantages by igniting terrain
  * Be careful using in areas with flammable terrain that might spread to you
  * Effective against enemies that don't kill you immediately, allowing the fire to work
  * Good against undead and cold-based enemies which typically take extra fire damage

==== Notes ====
Fire Arrows are a key part of the alchemy system, allowing players to create powerful ammunition from common resources. They're particularly useful for area denial and dealing with groups of enemies, though care should be taken with flammable terrain.
