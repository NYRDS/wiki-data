The **Kobold Icemancer** is an elite variant of the Kobold found in the [[rpd:ice_caves|Ice Caves]].

==== Description ====
The Kobold Icemancer is a more dangerous variant of the regular Kobold that can use magical ice attacks. These enemies are more threatening than regular Kobolds due to their magical abilities.

==== Stats ====
* HP: Moderate
* Defense: Low to Moderate
* Attack: Moderate, with ice magic
* Speed: Moderate
