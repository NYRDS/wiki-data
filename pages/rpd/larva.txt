==== Description ====
The **Larva** is a transforming mob found in the Guts level of Remixed Dungeon. It is a caterpillar-like creature that will evolve into another type of mob after gaining enough experience. The Old God Larva is mysterious creature that appears in the deepest level.

==== Stats ====
  * **HP**: 120
  * **Defense**: 20
  * **Attack**: 30
  * **Damage**: 25-30
  * **Defense Rating**: 8
  * **EXP**: 0 (no experience gained on kill)
  * **Level**: 1 (starts at level 1)

==== Behavior ====
  * The Larva will evolve into another mob when it reaches level 2 during its turn (the evolution happens automatically when the Larva acts while at level 2)
  * When evolving, it will transform into either a [[rpd:scorpio|Scorpio]], [[rpd:worm_mob|Worm]], or [[rpd:eye_mob|Eye]]
  * The transformation is accompanied by shadow particles and a cursed sound effect
  * The evolved mob appears in the same location as the Larva

==== Evolution Options ====
When the Larva evolves, it randomly becomes one of the following:
  * [[rpd:scorpio|Scorpio]] (50% chance) - Scorpio appears twice in the list, giving it a higher probability to evolve into Scorpio
  * [[rpd:worm_mob|Worm]] (25% chance)
  * [[rpd:eye_mob|Eye]] (25% chance)

==== Location ====
  * Found in the [[rpd:guts|Guts]] level (levels 28-30)
  * Floor 28: 1 larva per spawn
  * Floor 29: 2 larvae per spawn
  * Floor 30: 3 larvae per spawn

==== Strategy ====
  * The Larva is initially quite strong due to its high HP and damage
  * Since killing a Larva yields no experience, consider letting it evolve if experience is needed
  * Be prepared for the evolved mob, as it may be more dangerous than the Larva
  * Try to prevent the evolution by blocking the Larva's actions or forcing it to take damage to prevent it from leveling up

==== Content Verification ====
* Information source: Java class [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/nyrds/pixeldungeon/mobs/guts/Larva.java|Larva.java]]
* Stats verification: Extracted directly from Larva.java constructor and methods
* Effect descriptions: Based on string resources and in-game mechanics
* Updated for recent changes: As of December 2025, Larva evolution now includes Scorpio as a possible outcome (with 50% chance)
* Note: There is a bug in the code where Larva.getDescription() returns R.string.Yog_Desc instead of a proper Larva description
