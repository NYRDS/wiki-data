==== Description ====
The **Larva** is a transforming mob found in the Guts level of Remixed Dungeon. It is a caterpillar-like creature that will evolve into another type of mob after gaining enough experience. The Old God Larva is mysterious creature that appears in the deepest level.

==== Stats ====
  * **HP**: 120
  * **Defense**: 20
  * **Attack**: 30
  * **Damage**: 25-30
  * **Defense Rating**: 8
  * **EXP**: 0 (no experience gained on kill)
  * **Level**: 1 (starts at level 1)

==== Behavior ====
  * The Larva will evolve into another mob after reaching level 2 during its turn
  * When evolving, it will transform into either a [[rpd:scorpio|Scorpio]], [[rpd:worm|Worm]], or [[rpd:eye_mob|Eye]]
  * The transformation is accompanied by shadow particles and a cursed sound effect
  * The evolved mob appears in the same location as the Larva

==== Evolution Options ====
When the Larva evolves, it randomly becomes one of the following:
  * [[rpd:scorpio|Scorpio]] (25% chance)
  * [[rpd:worm|Worm]] (25% chance)
  * [[rpd:eye_mob|Eye]] (25% chance)
  * [[rpd:scorpio|Scorpio]] (25% chance) - Scorpio appears twice in the list, giving it a 50% chance to evolve into Scorpio

==== Location ====
  * Found in the [[rpd:guts|Guts]] level (levels 26-30)

==== Strategy ====
  * The Larva is initially quite strong due to its high HP and damage
  * Since killing a Larva yields no experience, consider letting it evolve if experience is needed
  * Be prepared for the evolved mob, as it may be more dangerous than the Larva
  * Try to prevent the evolution by blocking the Larva's actions or forcing it to take damage to prevent it from leveling up
