The **Tome of Mastery** is a powerful artifact that allows a hero to master a new subclass of their current class.

==== Description ====
This ancient tome contains the secrets of advanced techniques for a specific hero class. Reading it allows a hero to specialize in a mastery path and gain powerful subclass abilities.

==== Properties ====
  * **Type:** Artifact / Quest Item
  * **Rarity:** Unique
  * **Slot:** None (consumed when used)
  * **Class:** All (class-specific effect)

==== Usage ====
  * **Primary Function:** Grants access to a hero's subclass
  * **Consumed:** Yes, when read to select a subclass
  * **Restriction:** Only works for the appropriate hero class

==== Acquisition ====
  * **Sources:**
    * Dropped by [[rpd:tengu_mob|Tengu]] in the Prison area (if subclass not yet acquired and hero is not Necromancer or Gnoll)
    * Found in special level containers
    * Granted through certain quests
  * **Drop Rate:** 100% from Tengu if subclass not yet acquired
  * **Limitation:** Each hero can only use one Tome of Mastery

==== Mechanics ====

  * After selection, permanently grants access to the chosen subclass abilities
  * Consumed upon use, with no replacement available
  * Critical item for character development and specialization

==== Notes ====
