====== Liquid Flame ======

**Liquid Flame** is a harmful environmental effect in Remixed Dungeon that causes damage to characters standing within its area.

==== Description ====
Liquid Flame is a burning effect that persists on the floor for several turns, damaging all characters that stand in it. It's created when a [[rpd:potion_of_liquid_flame_item|Potion of Liquid Flame]] is shattered on the ground.

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Damage:** Causes fire damage each turn to characters in the affected area
  * **Duration:** Persists for several turns before dissipating
  * **Area of Effect:** Covers a 3x3 area around the impact point where the potion was shattered
  * **Spread:** Can spread to adjacent flammable terrain
  * **Fire Resistance:** Enemies with fire resistance take reduced damage

==== Creation ====
  * **Primary Method:** Created when [[rpd:potion_of_liquid_flame_item|Potion of Liquid Flame]] is shattered
  * **Volume:** Creates an area with 10 units of liquid flame initially
  * **Quality Factor:** The ''qualityFactor()'' affects the volume of liquid flame produced
  * **Visual Effect:** Shows fire animation on affected floor tiles

==== Interactions ====
  * **Terrain:** Can ignite flammable terrain like grass and barricades
  * **Fire Immunity:** Characters immune to fire take no damage
  * **Environmental Interaction:** Part of the game's fire mechanics system
  * **Combustion:** Continues burning until it naturally extinguishes or is put out

==== Strategy ====
  * **Offensive Use:** Damage groups of enemies by creating liquid flame areas
  * **Area Denial:** Block passages with burning areas to prevent enemy approach
  * **Tactical Positioning:** Avoid standing in liquid flame to prevent damage
  * **Enemy Considerations:** Fire-immune enemies are unaffected by liquid flame
