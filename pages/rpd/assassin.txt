{{ rpd:images:hero_ROGUE_ASSASSIN.png|Assassin }}

The Assassin is the Rogue's subclass in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Unlocking ====
The Assassin subclass can be unlocked by using a Tome of Mastery after defeating the second boss (Tengu).

==== Special Mechanics ====
When an enemy attacks the Assassin while the Assassin is unseen (invisible or out of sight), the enemy takes additional damage from the attack.

==== Special Armor ====
Using an Armor Kit on any armor will transform it into the [[rpd:assassin_armor|Assassin Armor]], which is specifically designed for this subclass.

==== Advantages ====
  * Bonus damage to enemies when they attack the Assassin while unseen
  * Effective for stealth-based gameplay
  * High damage potential when enemies attack an invisible or out-of-sight Assassin
  * Synergizes well with invisible or out-of-sight positioning

==== Disadvantages ====
  * Only effective when enemies attack the unseen Assassin
  * Requires careful positioning and stealth
  * Less effective in direct confrontation situations
