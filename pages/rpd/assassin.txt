The Assassin is the Rogue's subclass in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Unlocking ====
The Assassin subclass can be unlocked by using a Tome of Mastery after defeating the second boss (Tengu).

==== Special Mechanics ====
When the Assassin is attacked by an enemy while the Assassin is unseen by that enemy, the enemy takes additional damage from the attack. This happens when the Assassin is invisible or out of the attacking enemy's line of sight.

==== Special Armor ====
Using an [[rpd:armor_kit_item|Armor Kit]] on any armor will transform it into the [[rpd:assassin_armor|Assassin Armor]], which is specifically designed for this subclass.

==== Advantages ====
  * Bonus damage to enemies when they attack the Assassin while unseen
  * Effective for stealth-based gameplay
  * High damage potential when enemies attack an invisible or out-of-sight Assassin
  * Synergizes well with invisible or out-of-sight positioning

==== Disadvantages ====
  * Only effective when enemies attack the unseen Assassin
  * Requires careful positioning and stealth
  * Less effective in direct confrontation situations
