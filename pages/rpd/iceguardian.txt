**Ice Guardian Core** is the boss of the [[rpd:ice_caves|Ice Caves]] area in Remixed Dungeon. It is manufactured by ancient kobolds to protect their icy caves, with power stored within its core allowing it to reconstruct itself as long as it has enough energy.

==== Description ====
The Ice Guardian Core is a massive construct made of magical ice, created by the ancient kobolds to protect their realm. It has a glowing stone placed inside this wondrous construction at its core. Unlike the regular Ice Guardians that are made by this core, the Core itself is the actual boss entity.
