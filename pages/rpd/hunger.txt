====== Hunger System ======

{{ rpd:images:buff_Hunger.png|Hunger }}

The Hunger system is a game mechanic that gradually increases the player's hunger level over time, leading to negative effects if not managed properly.

==== Description ====
Hunger is a status effect that accumulates over time. As the hunger level increases, the hero's health gradually decreases. If the hunger level reaches the "Starving" threshold, the hero will start taking damage each turn.

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Hunger Thresholds:**
    * **Normal**: No penalties
    * **Hungry**: 280 units (defined as Hunger.HUNGRY constant)
    * **Starving**: 400 units (defined as Hunger.STARVING constant)
  * **Damage:** When starving, the hero takes damage equal to max(1, effectiveSTR() - 10) in higher difficulties (difficulty ≥ 3)
  * **Recovery:** Eating food items reduces the hunger level by the food's energy value

==== Food Values ====
  * **Ration**: Provides 100 energy units
  * **Overpriced Ration**: Provides 100 energy units
  * **Rotten Ration**: Provides 60 energy units (calculated as (HUNGRY - STARVING)/2)
  * **Frozen Carpaccio**: Provides 50 energy units
  * **Mystery Meat**: Provides 50 energy units
  * **Chargrilled Meat**: Provides 50 energy units
  * **Pasty**: Provides 80 energy units
  * **Other foods**: Vary according to their type

==== Strategic Considerations ====
  * Higher difficulties accelerate the hunger rate and cause more significant damage when starving
  * Carrying multiple food items is essential for survival in deep dungeon runs
  * Food can be preserved by storing it in special containers to prevent spoilage
