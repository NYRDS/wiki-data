The **Spider Nest Level** is a special dungeon level in Remixed Dungeon that is filled with spiders and their nests.

==== Description ====
The Spider Nest Level is a unique special level that features an abundance of spiders and spider-related content. Unlike other levels, it has unique mechanics where spiders spawn from nests and eggs rather than appearing randomly, creating a different kind of challenge for the player.

==== Layout ====
  * No traditional doors, but plenty of plants growing everywhere
  * Different floor plan compared to standard levels
  * Contains multiple spider nests that continuously spawn spiders
  * Contains spider eggs that hatch into spiders after a certain time
  * Generally more hazardous due to the large number of spiders

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Special Spawning:** Mobs (spiders) come from spider nests and eggs, not random spawning
  * **Continuous Pressure:** Spider nests create ongoing pressure by continuously spawning spiders
  * **Spider Egg Hatching:** Spider eggs hatch after 20 turns if not destroyed
  * **Nest Management:** Players must decide how to handle spider nests strategically

==== Navigation Strategy ====
  * **Nest Management:** Destroy spider nests to reduce spawning pressure
  * **Egg Prioritization:** Destroy spider eggs quickly before they hatch
  * **Area Control:** Carefully manage which areas to clear first
  * **Resource Management:** These levels can be resource-intensive due to continuous spawns

==== Enemies ====
  * Various types of spiders (servants, guards, etc.)
  * [[rpd:spider_queen_mob|Spider Queen]] may be present as a boss
  * [[rpd:spider_egg_mob|Spider Eggs]] that hatch into spiders

==== Items and Rewards ====
