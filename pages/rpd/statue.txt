**Statue** is a mob in Remixed Dungeon that appears as an inanimate statue but can animate to fight when disturbed.

==== Description ====
The Statue is a deceptive enemy that appears as an inanimate statue until activated. When attacked or approached, it comes to life and fights with a random weapon it's carrying. Statues are typically found in rooms designated as statue rooms in the dungeon.

==== Stats ====
  * **Level:** Depends on dungeon depth (HP: 15 + 5 * dungeon depth)
  * **HP:** 15 + 5 * dungeon depth
  * **Defense:** 4 + dungeon depth
  * **Attack:** Same as defense (4 + dungeon depth)
  * **Damage:** dungeon depth / 4 + 1 to dungeon depth
  * **EXP:** 0 when killed (no experience gained)
  * **Carcass:** No (doesn't leave a corpse for Cook)

==== Abilities ====
  * **Passive:** Remains motionless until disturbed, flagged in the journal as "Statue"
  * **Equipment:** Armed with a random melee weapon (level appropriate) that has a random enchantment
  * **Resistances:** Immune to Toxic Gas and Poison
  * **Resistances:** Resistant to Death enchantment and Psionic Blast scroll
  * **Immunities:** Immune to Leech enchantment and Bleeding status effect
  * **Armor Type:** Considered to be wearing armor appropriate for its weapon type
  * **Sprite:** Takes on the appearance of its equipped item when animated

==== Special Variants ====
  * **Armored Statue:** Similar to regular statue but typically equipped with armor
  * **Golden Statue:** Special variant that may contain valuable items (see [[rpd:golden_statue|Golden Statue]])

==== Strategy ====
  * **Detection:** Statues are marked in your journal when visible, making them easy to identify
  * **Equipment:** Approach knowing that the statue will likely have a weapon advantage based on dungeon level
  * **Distance:** Consider ranged attacks to avoid immediate retaliation
  * **Preparation:** Have healing items ready since statues may be equipped with dangerous weapons/enchantments
