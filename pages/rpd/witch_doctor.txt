The Witch Doctor is the Necromancer's subclass in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Unlocking ====
The Witch Doctor subclass can be unlocked by using a Tome of Mastery after defeating the second boss (Tengu).

==== Special Mechanics ====
Spellcasting endows the _Witchdoctor_ with a magic shield that completely protects him from incoming damage.

  * Allows safer casting in dangerous situations
  * Synergizes well with Necromancer's spell focus

==== Disadvantages ====
