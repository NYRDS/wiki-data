====== Chaos Set ======

The **Chaos Set** consists of several items that feature chaotic properties and auto-upgrading mechanics.

==== Chaos Crystal ====

The [[rpd:chaos_crystal|Chaos Crystal]] is an artifact that can be worn as a ring. This item has the "Mark of Chaos" ability. To use it, you need to collect enough energy in the crystal, which can be done by killing monsters. The "Mark of Chaos" can create a random effect on the tile that you choose, such as burning the chosen tile or creating a gas cloud.

If you identify the crystal, you can see how many charges it has at the moment (100 is max). If you identify the crystal for the second time, then you will have the ability to Fuse (requires at least 50 charges) it with the items that are listed below:

  * Scroll
  * Piece of Armor
  * Melee Weapon
  * Ranged Weapon
  * Wand

Upon fusing:
  * Fusing a scroll with a chaos crystal produces a scroll of enchantment
  * Other items get chaotic properties when fused

==== Chaos Sword ====

The [[rpd:chaos_sword|Chaos Sword]] is a tier-3 melee weapon. It requires 14 points of strength and the average damage is 9 points. It can't be upgraded traditionally, but it upgrades itself when you kill enough mobs. The sword can also enchant itself and it will lose upgrades if you don't use it for some time.

==== Chaos Armor ====

The [[rpd:chaos_armor|Chaos Armor]] is a tier-3 armor. It requires 13 points of strength and it can absorb up to 6 points of damage. The upgrade system works the same way as the chaos sword.

==== Chaos Bow ====

The [[rpd:chaos_bow|Chaos Bow]] is a tier-3 ranged weapon. It requires 14 points of strength and similarly to the chaos sword it auto-upgrades and auto-enchants.

==== Chaos Staff ====

The [[rpd:chaos_staff|Chaos Staff]] has 2 charges in the beginning and can also upgrade itself. The effects of the staff are the same as of the "Mark of Chaos", creating random effects like gases, burning tiles, growing grass and etc.

==== Chaos Shield ====

The [[rpd:chaos_shield|Chaos Shield]] is a special shield created by fusing a Chaos Crystal with an ordinary shield, causing it to manifest random chaotic effects upon a successful block. The shield is implemented as a Lua script and shares similar self-upgrading mechanics with other chaos items - it can degrade if not used and upgrade when the hero takes damage, with charge management similar to other chaos items.

==== Strategy ====

Items in the chaos set offer unique gameplay mechanics with self-upgrading abilities, making them powerful but requiring active use to maintain their effectiveness.
