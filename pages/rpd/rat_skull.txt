==== Stats ====
  * **Rarity**: Quest artifact
  * **Weight**: 1
  * **Price**: 100 gold
  * **Identified by default**: Yes
  * **Artifact**: Yes

==== Description ====
The Giant Rat Skull is an artifact that provides the Ratter buff - an aura that terrifies all other rodents around, making them flee from the skull bearer. It could be a nice hunting trophy, but it smells too bad to place it on a wall. On the other hand, it demonstrates that the owner is capable of killing rats, even big and smelly ones.

==== Acquisition ====
  * Received from the Ghost NPC upon your first meeting if you have not already obtained one
  * Sometimes received as a reward from the Ghost NPC quest

==== Buff Effect (Ratter) ====
  * **Name**: Ratter
  * **Effect**: Terrifies all other rodents around, making them flee from the skull bearer
  * **Description**: The acrid stench terrifies all other rodents around, making them flee from the skull bearer

==== Usage ====
  * **Rodent Deterrent:** Makes all rodents in the dungeon flee from you
  * **Artifact:** Functions as an ongoing buff while in your inventory
  * **Quest Completion Marker:** Indicates you have completed the Ghost's quest

==== Trivia ====
  * The Giant Rat Skull is one of the few artifacts that provides a social effect rather than a direct combat enhancement
  * While it has defensive utility against rodent enemies, the smell doesn't seem to affect other types of creatures
