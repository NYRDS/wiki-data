The Ghost is a non-hostile NPC in Remixed Dungeon that appears in the sewers and gives players a special quest.

==== Description ====
The Ghost is a sad spirit found in the sewers who has lost his precious rose and is looking for help to recover it. This NPC offers a quest to players: collect either 8 rat corpses or defeat a special Fetid Rat to receive special equipment.

==== Appearance ====
  * The Ghost only appears in the Sewer level (levels 1-5) and spawns after level 1 with a probability of (5 - Dungeon depth)
  * This spawns only once per game and is never re-spawned

==== Quest Mechanics ====
  * The Ghost's quest has two possible paths:
  * **Traditional Path:** Collect 8 regular rat corpses and return them to the Ghost
  * **Alternative Path:** Talk to the Ghost to receive the quest, then kill the special Fetid Rat that spawns in the level
  * The quest path is randomly determined when the Ghost spawns
  * Players can only complete one of the two quest paths
  * Both paths reward the player with a special weapon and armor appropriate to their level

==== Quest Rewards ====
  * Upon completing either quest path, players receive:
  * A weapon from Treasury.Category.WEAPON (Tier 4 or better), excluding missile weapons
  * An armor from Treasury.Category.ARMOR (Tier 4)
  * Both items are automatically identified
  * The reward items are unique to this quest and represent some of the best early-game equipment

==== Class Specifics ====
  * **Necromancer Class:** The Ghost quest is modified for this class, with the Necromancer having different dialogue options and interactions with the ghost

==== Strategy ====
  * The traditional path is straightforward but requires hunting rats
  * The alternative path with the Fetid Rat is often considered easier since the Fetid Rat always drops the required Rat Skull item
  * The Fetid Rat also has a special ability to create clouds of Paralytic Gas when attacked
  * Both rewards are high-quality equipment that will benefit players throughout the early game
