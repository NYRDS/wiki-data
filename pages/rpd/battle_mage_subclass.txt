{{ rpd:images:hero_MAGE_BATTLEMAGE.png|Battle Mage }}

The **Battle Mage** is the Mage's subclass in Remixed Dungeon. The Battle Mage specializes in direct offensive magic and melee combat with their staff.

==== Unlocking ====
The Battle Mage subclass can be unlocked by using a [[rpd:tome_of_mastery_item|Tome of Mastery]] after defeating the second boss (Tengu).

==== Special Mechanics ====
When fighting with a wand in his hands, the _Battlemage_ inflicts additional damage equal to the current number of charges AND restores 1 charge to the wand if it's below maximum capacity and the hit deals damage. The wand's charges are only restored when the wand is not at maximum charges and if the attack successfully deals damage to the target.

==== Abilities ====
  * **Staff Mastery:** Enhanced combat effectiveness with staves
  * **Offensive Magic:** Specialization in direct-damage spells
  * **Combat Channeling:** Ability to use wand charges in conjunction with staff attacks (additional damage = current charges)
  * **Wand Charge Restoration:** When attack successfully deals damage, restores 1 charge to the wand if it's below maximum capacity
  * **Magical Defense:** Some defensive magical protections

==== Playstyle ====
The Battle Mage playstyle focuses on:
  * **Aggressive Magic:** Using powerful spells offensively in combat
  * **Melee Magic:** Combining staff attacks with magical energy
  * **Wand Synergy:** Using various wands as part of the combat strategy
  * **Wand Sustainability:** Maximizing wand efficiency through charge restoration mechanics

==== Special Armor ====
Using an [[rpd:armor_kit_item|Armor Kit]] on any armor will transform it into the [[rpd:battle_mage_armor|Battle Mage Armor]], which is specifically designed for this subclass.

==== Advantages ====
  * Additional damage based on wand charges (damage bonus = current charges)
  * Wand charges are restored with each successful hit (when wand is not at maximum charges and hit deals damage)
  * Provides excellent wand sustainability
  * Synergizes well with all wands
  * Enables effective wand combat in close quarters

==== Disadvantages ====
  * Requires using wands to be effective
  * Less effective with melee weapons
  * Wand dependency for the subclass abilities
