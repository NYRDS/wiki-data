====== Fear ======

**Fear** is a general game mechanic in Remixed Pixel Dungeon that causes characters to become frightened, typically resulting in fleeing behavior and impaired functionality.

==== Effects ====
  * **Terror Status**: Most commonly manifests as the [[rpd:terror|Terror]] status effect
  * **Fleeing Behavior**: Affected characters prioritize escaping over other actions
  * **Combat Impairment**: Reduced effectiveness in combat situations
  * **Movement Priority**: Moving away from sources of fear

==== Causes ====
Fear can be induced by:
  * [[rpd:scroll_of_terror|Scroll of Terror]] (creates terror status)
  * Special abilities of certain mobs
  * Environmental effects or cursed items
  * Boss monsters with fear-inducing abilities

==== Counters ====
  * [[rpd:resistances|Fear Resistance]] reduces susceptibility to fear effects
  * [[rpd:terror|Terror]]-specific cures also counter fear effects
  * Some equipment provides fear immunity
  * Bravery-related buffs may provide protection
