{{ rpd:images:item_GothicArmor.png|Gothic Armor }}

==== Description ====
A gothic armor is a pinnacle of the art of armor forging. It's a heavy plate armor that covers the entire body, offering excellent protection but requiring significant strength to wear effectively.

==== Stats ====
  * **Defense Rating:** 12 (base protection, calculated as tier * 2)
  * **Strength Requirement:** 19 (calculated as 7 + tier * 2)
  * **Durability:** Standard armor durability
  * **Type:** Heavy armor

==== Special Properties ====
  * Offers excellent protection due to high armor class
  * High strength requirement makes it difficult to use for low-strength characters
  * Reduces movement speed due to weight
  * Provides good protection against physical attacks

==== Availability ====
  * Found as dungeon loot in deeper levels
  * Part of high-tier treasure spawns
  * May appear in special containers or hidden areas

==== Strategy ====
  * Best used by characters with high strength (Warrior, Berserker subclass)
  * Provides excellent protection in late-game scenarios
  * The high strength requirement makes it less viable for classes without strength bonuses
  * Consider the movement penalty in tactical situations
