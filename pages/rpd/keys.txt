====== Keys ======

{{ rpd:images:item_IronKey.png|Iron Key }}

**Keys** are special items in Remixed Dungeon used to unlock doors and chests throughout the dungeon. Different keys are required for different locked areas.

==== Types of Keys ====
  * **Iron Keys** - Most common, used for standard doors and chests
  * **Skeleton Keys** - Special keys that open most locks without being consumed
  * **Special Keys** - Unique keys for specific areas (e.g., [[rpd:ice_key_item|Ice Key]], [[rpd:skeleton_key_item|Skeleton Key]])

==== Usage ====
  * Keys are automatically used when approaching locked doors or chests
  * Each key is typically consumed upon use (except Skeleton Keys)
  * Keys are stored separately from other items in the inventory

==== Availability ====
  * Found as drops from enemies
  * Located in treasure rooms
  * Sometimes found in chests
  * Purchased from shops

==== Strategy ====
  * Keep a few keys in reserve as you progress through the dungeon
  * Prioritize opening chests over doors if gold is low
  * The [[rpd:skeleton_key_item|Skeleton Key]] is valuable for preserving other keys
  * Some areas require specific keys that can't be substituted
