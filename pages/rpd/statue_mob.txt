The **Statue** is a magical construct found in the dungeon. It is typically animated by magic and will attack any living being that comes near it.

==== Overview ====
Statues are stone constructs animated by magic. They remain motionless until disturbed, at which point they become aggressive. They have high defense but are generally not very dangerous to well-equipped heroes.

==== Stats ====
  * **HP**: 15
  * **Defense Skill**: 8
  * **Attack Skill**: 12
  * **Damage**: 1-10
  * **DR**: 4
  * **EXP**: 4

==== Abilities ====
  * **False Appearance**: Remains motionless until a character moves next to it
  * **Immunities**: Immune to most status effects (poison, paralysis, etc.)

==== Combat Tactics ====
Statues only become active when approached. They're not particularly dangerous individually, but can be a nuisance due to their high armor and immunity to many effects. They're most commonly found in the sewers and prison levels.

==== Occurrence ====
  * **Primary Locations**: Sewers, Prison
  * **Special Feature**: Often found holding an item, which they will drop when defeated

==== Strategy ====
  * Approach with caution, as they'll become hostile when approached
  * They're immune to many effects, so direct damage is most effective
  * Be aware they may be covering items that are revealed when they're defeated
