====== Spell Affinities ======

Spell affinities in Remixed Pixel Dungeon are categories that group spells based on their magical properties and the classes that can use them. Each hero class has a primary affinity that determines which spells they can effectively use.

==== Affinity Types ====
  * [[rpd:common|Common Affinity]] - Basic spells available to most classes
  * [[rpd:elemental|Elemental Affinity]] - Fire, ice, and nature-based spells
  * [[rpd:necromancy|Necromancy Affinity]] - Undead and death-related spells
  * [[rpd:combat|Combat Affinity]] - Offensive and defensive spells
  * [[rpd:rogue|Rogue Affinity]] - Stealth and agility spells
  * [[rpd:witchcraft|Witchcraft Affinity]] - Magic and manipulation spells
  * [[rpd:huntress|Huntress Affinity]] - Nature and charm spells
  * [[rpd:elf|Elf Affinity]] - Natural magic spells
  * [[rpd:priest|Priest Affinity]] - Healing and sanctity spells
  * [[rpd:plague_doctor|Plague Doctor Affinity]] - Disease and toxic spells

==== Affinity Mechanics ====
  * Each hero class has a primary affinity which determines spell effectiveness
