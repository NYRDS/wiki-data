====== Combat Mechanic ======

**Combat** is the core mechanic governing how attacks, damage, and defensive maneuvers work in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Attack Resolution ====
Combat follows these steps when an attack occurs:
  1. Calculate attacker's **Attack Skill** from [[rpd:attack_skill|attack skill]] value
  2. Calculate defender's **Defense Skill** from [[rpd:defence_skill|defense skill]] value
  3. Compare values to determine if the attack hits or misses
  4. If the attack hits, calculate damage based on attacker's damage range and defender's [[rpd:armor_class|armor]]

==== Damage Calculation ====
  * **Damage Dealt** = Random value between min_damage and max_damage of the weapon
  * **Damage Received** = Damage dealt reduced by armor value using the formula: armor/(armor+100)
  * Armor can completely negate damage if high enough

==== Combat Parameters ====
  * **Attack Delay** - Time between attacks, affected by weapon speed
  * **Hit Chance** - Probability of hitting based on attack vs defense
  * **Critical Hits** - Chance to deal extra damage (varies by weapon)

==== Special Combat Mechanics ====
  * **Dual Wielding** - Attack with two weapons at once with penalties
  * **Ranged Attacks** - Attack at distance with different mechanics
  * **Area of Effect** - Abilities that affect multiple targets
  * **Status Effects** - Conditions that affect combat (stun, paralysis, etc.)

==== Combat-Related Items ====
  * [[rpd:weapons|Weapons]] - Deal damage to enemies
  * [[rpd:armor|Armor]] - Reduce incoming damage
  * [[rpd:rings|Rings]] - Various combat-enhancing effects
  * [[rpd:potions|Potions]] - Combat-beneficial effects
  * [[rpd:scrolls|Scrolls]] - Combat-oriented magical effects

==== Strategies ====
  * Maintain distance when fighting strong melee enemies
  * Use terrain to your advantage (choking corridors, doors)
  * Balance attack power with defensive capabilities
  * Use environmental effects (traps, [[rpd:liquid_flame|fire]], etc.)
