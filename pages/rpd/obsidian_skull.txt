The **Obsidian Skull** is an alternative name for the [[rpd:black_skull|Black Skull]] artifact. It is obtained from the [[rpd:lich|Lich]] boss in the Necropolis.

==== Mechanics ====
The Black Skull is an artifact that can be wielded by the [[rpd:necromancer|Necromancer]] class. It works by collecting charges when hostile creatures die nearby. Once it reaches maximum charge (10), it becomes "awakened" and can be used to resurrect defeated enemies as pets for the player.

After resurrection, the skull loses 10 charges. If it drops to 0 charges while awakened, it becomes dormant again until recharged.

==== Alternate Form ====
For [[rpd:necromancer|Necromancer]] class players, the Lich drops a special version called the [[rpd:soul_reaper|Soul Reaper]] instead of the standard Black Skull.

==== Code Reference ====
The Black Skull mechanics are implemented in [[code:com/nyrds/pixeldungeon/items/necropolis/BlackSkull.java|BlackSkull.java]].
