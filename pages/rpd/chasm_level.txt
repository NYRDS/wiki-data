====== Chasm Level ======

The Chasm Level is a special level feeling that appears in Remixed Dungeon with a 20% chance on random dungeon levels. It is characterized by many chasms (bottomless pits) throughout the level.

==== Features ====
  * **Chasms**: Large sections of floor are replaced with chasms that cause instant death if fallen into
  * **Limited movement**: Players must carefully navigate to avoid falling into chasms
  * **Unique enemies**: Certain enemies like [[rpd:air_elemental_mob|Air Elementals]] appear exclusively or more frequently in this environment
  * **Special mechanics**: Some items and abilities may interact differently with the chasm environment

==== Strategy ====
  * Be extremely cautious with movement, especially when being chased by enemies
  * Use items that reveal the map like [[rpd:scroll_of_magic_mapping_item|Scroll of Magic Mapping]]
  * Consider items that provide safe movement like [[rpd:scroll_of_teleportation_item|Scroll of Teleportation]]
  * Stay away from the edges of platforms when fighting multiple enemies
  * Some ranged enemies (like [[rpd:air_elemental_mob|Air Elementals]]) can push you into chasms with their attacks
