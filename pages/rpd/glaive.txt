==== Strategy ====
  * The 2-tile range allows you to attack enemies while staying out of their reach
  * Effective against single targets, but can't hit multiple enemies in one attack
  * Works well in corridors where you can maintain distance from enemies
  * The high max damage makes it powerful against tough enemies when you connect
  * Upgrades will increase damage and reduce required strength (MIN+1, MAX+tier, STR-1)
  * Consider using with other ranged weapons or magic items for maximum effectiveness
  * With upgrades, the damage scales significantly (each upgrade: +1 min damage, +5 max damage with tier 5)
