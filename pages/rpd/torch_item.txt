**Torch** is a utility item in Remixed Dungeon that provides light in dark dungeon areas.

==== Description ====
The Torch is a basic light source that temporarily increases the hero's field of vision in dark dungeon areas. It can be especially useful for exploring and identifying dangers from a distance.

  * **Type**: Utility Item
  * **Stacks**: Yes
  * **Weight**: 1

  * **Degrades**: Yes (burns out after a time)

==== Uses ====
  * Provides light for 5 turns when lit
  * Allows hero to see further in dark areas
  * Can be used strategically to reveal hidden enemies or traps
  * Can be combined with fire-based attacks to light flammable elements

  * Sometimes found in containers like [[rpd:chests_mechanic|Chests]]
  * May be dropped by certain [[rpd:mobs|Mobs]]

==== Strategy ====
  * Use torches to safely scout ahead in dark corridors
