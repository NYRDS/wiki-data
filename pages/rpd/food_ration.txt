**Ration of Food** is a type of food item found in Remixed Pixel Dungeon. It is the standard food ration that all heroes start with.

==== Description ====
The Ration of Food is the basic food item that provides sustenance during dungeon exploration. It is the most common food item found throughout the dungeon.

==== Properties ====
  * **Heal Amount:** Restores 5 hunger points
  * **Nutrition:** Basic nutrition (1 hunger point per 20% of food consumed)
  * **Overeating Effect:** Causes brief nausea (reduces effectiveness by 60% for subsequent food consumption)
  * **Type:** Basic food (not rotting)
  * **Hunger Restored:** 5 hunger points
  * **Weight:** 1

==== Usage ====
  * Consumed when hunger reaches approximately 25% of max hunger
  * Can be eaten manually via the inventory menu
  * Restores the hunger bar when consumed
  * Useful for long dungeon exploration sessions

==== Availability ====
  * Starting equipment for all hero classes (except Gnoll)
  * Found in chests throughout the dungeon
  * Sold in shops
  * Dropped by some enemies
  * More common in the earlier dungeon levels

==== Strategy ====
  * The most reliable food source in the dungeon
  * Should be conserved for longer expeditions
  * Generally not worth saving if other food types are available
  * Essential backup food for emergencies
  * Eating multiple rations in succession is inefficient due to overeating penalties
