* Keep your distance when she's at full health since she can only attack adjacent enemies
* Be prepared for poison damage with antidotes or healing
* Be aware that she will retreat when below 50% health, potentially making it harder to finish the fight

* Be ready to deal with spawned Spider Eggs during the fight
