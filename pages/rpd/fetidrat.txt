The **Fetid Rat** is a special mob that appears in Remixed Dungeon as part of the Ghost quest for Necromancer hero class, or as an alternative reward for the Ghost quest for other classes.

==== Description ====
The Fetid Rat is a diseased-looking rat that follows the player character. It appears as part of the Ghost's quest line, either as a reward for Necromancer players who choose to befriend the Ghost, or as an alternative to the Dried Rose quest for non-Necromancers who convince the Ghost to give up his quest for revenge.
