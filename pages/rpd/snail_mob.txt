The **Snail** is a very weak enemy found in the earliest levels of the dungeon in Remixed Dungeon. It's the slowest-moving creature in the game making it more of a curiosity than a real threat.

==== Description ====
This small mollusk has grown quite big by feeding on sewage, but he is still really slow which makes him an easy foe to face. They're found only on the very first levels of the dungeon and are so slow and weak that they're more of a curiosity than an actual threat.

==== Stats ====
  * **HP**: 6
  * **Defense Skill**: 2
  * **Attack Skill**: 6
  * **Damage**: 1-3
  * **Damage Reduction**: 1 (DR)
  * **Speed**: 0.5x (half speed of normal creatures)
  * **Attack Delay**: 1
  * **View Distance**: 3 tiles
  * **Exp Given**: 1
  * **Loot Chance**: 0%
  * **Max Level**: 2
  * **Movement Type**: Normal
  * **Can be Pet**: Yes
  * **Flying**: No
  * **Friendly**: No

==== Abilities ====
  * **Extremely Slow**: Moves at half speed (0.5x), making it the slowest creature in the game
  * **Low Threat**: Very low stats make it virtually harmless

==== Behavior ====
  * Moves extremely slowly
  * Poses virtually no threat to the player
  * Can become a pet if interacted with properly
  * Rare spawn on dungeon levels 1-4 (with decreasing probability after level 1)

==== Drops ====
Snails have a 0% chance to drop items, but may occasionally drop small amounts of gold based on base gold drop mechanics.

==== Location ====
Based on Bestiary.json spawn configuration:
  * Level 1: 1x spawn weight
  * Level 2: 1x spawn weight (with 0.03x for Deep Snail)
  * Level 3-4: Not normally spawned (though could appear through other means)

==== Strategy ====
  * The Snail poses no threat to the player
  * Can be safely ignored or picked up as a pet
  * Due to its extreme slowness, it will rarely be able to catch up with the player
  * Good target for new players to practice combat mechanics

==== Special Notes ====
  * The slowest creature in the game
  * Can be made into a pet
  * Extremely rare enemy that most players will never encounter
  * Most players will never encounter one
  * Related to Plague Doctor quest which requires 10 Snail carcasses
