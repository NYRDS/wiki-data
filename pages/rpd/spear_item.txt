Spears are a type of [[rpd:melee_weapon|melee weapon]] in Remixed Dungeon that feature longer reach compared to other close combat weapons.

==== Description ====
Spears are polearm weapons that offer extended reach compared to shorter melee weapons. This reach advantage allows the wielder to attack enemies while staying out of immediate retaliation range.

==== Weapon Properties ====
  * **Damage Type:** Piercing damage
  * **Speed:** Generally slower attack speed
  * **Accuracy:** Good accuracy
  * **Reach:** Extended reach allows attacking from a distance
  * **Upgrade Potential:** Can be upgraded with [[rpd:scroll_of_upgrade_item|Scrolls of Upgrade]]
  * **Enchantments:** Compatible with [[rpd:weapon_enchantments|weapon enchantments]]

==== Available Spears ====
  * **Spear** - Basic spear weapon
  * [[rpd:glaive_item|Glaive]] - Heavier spear variant with longer reach
  * **Quarterstaff** - Balanced spear-like weapon

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Extended Reach:** Allows attacking enemies from further away than normal
  * **Reach Advantage:** Can attack enemies while staying out of their counter-attack range
  * **Polearm Properties:** Special properties that may affect combat positioning

==== Strategy ====
  * Spears are effective against single enemies due to their reach
  * Useful for controlling dungeon corridors and choke points
  * Best used against enemies that cannot close the distance quickly
  * Consider positioning carefully to maximize reach advantage
  * May be less effective against multiple enemies due to slower attack speed
