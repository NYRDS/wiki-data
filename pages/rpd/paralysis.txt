====== Paralysis ======

Paralysis is a status effect in Remixed Dungeon that prevents a character from taking any actions for a period of time.

==== Description ====
When a character is paralyzed, they are completely immobilized and unable to perform any actions until the effect wears off or is cured. This includes movement, attacking, using items, or casting spells.

==== Effects ====
  * **Action Prevention:** Paralyzed characters cannot take any actions
  * **Duration:** Standard duration is 10 turns, modified by resistance effects
  * **Vulnerability:** Paralyzed targets are vulnerable to attacks
  * **Automatic Recovery:** Effect ends automatically after time expires
  * **Break Chance:** Paralyzed characters have a chance to break free when taking damage (chance based on damage dealt vs current HP)
  * **Visual Indicator:** Paralyzed characters display a specific status animation

==== Causes ====
  * [[rpd:potion_of_paralytic_gas|Potion of Paralytic Gas]] - Thrown potion that creates a gas cloud causing paralysis
  * [[rpd:paralysis_arrow|Paralysis Arrow]] - Thrown missile that applies 4 turns of paralysis
  * Paralysis weapon enchantment - Chance to apply stun (similar to paralysis) on hit
  * Certain enemy attacks - Some creatures can paralyze with their attacks
  * Special spells - Some spells may cause paralysis
  * Cursed items - Rarely, cursed equipment might cause paralysis

==== Immunities ====
  * Some creatures like the [[rpd:fetidrat|Fetid Rat]] are immune to paralysis
  * [[rpd:pasty_mimic|Pasty-Mimic]] is immune to paralysis along with toxic gas and stun
  * [[rpd:lich_mob|Lich]] is immune to paralysis
  * [[rpd:undead_mobs|Undead]] creatures often have resistance or immunity
  * Resistance from rings or armor may reduce duration

==== Strategy ====
  * **For Players:** Use paralytic effects to gain tactical advantages
  * **Defensively:** Try to avoid being paralyzed in dangerous situations
  * **Offensively:** Paralyze powerful enemies to gain breathing room
  * **Timing:** Consider the duration when planning your next actions
  * **Damage Breaking:** If paralyzed, taking damage might help break free (chance based on damage dealt vs HP)

==== Countermeasures ====
  * Potions of cure poison do NOT cure paralysis (different effect)
  * Rings of Elements may provide resistance to reduce duration
  * Avoiding paralytic attacks or items when possible
  * Taking damage may occasionally break the effect

==== Technical Details ====
  * **Java Class:** [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/watabou/pixeldungeon/actors/buffs/Paralysis.java|com.watabou.pixeldungeon.actors.buffs.Paralysis]]
  * **Default Duration:** 10 turns (DURATION constant)
  * **Visual State:** CharSprite.State.PARALYSED
  * **Breaking Mechanism:** Chance to break when damage dealt >= Random.Int(damage) vs Random.Int(target.hp())
