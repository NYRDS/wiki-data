====== Ranged Weapon ======

{{ rpd:images:bow_item.png|Ranged Weapon }}

**Ranged Weapons** allow the hero to attack enemies from a distance without entering adjacent squares. These are important for tactical advantage and avoiding dangerous close combat.

==== Types of Ranged Weapons ====
  * [[rpd:bow_item|Bows]] - Basic ranged weapons that require ammunition
  * [[rpd:crossbow_item|Crossbows]] - More powerful than bows, also require ammunition
  * [[rpd:throwing_weapons|Throwing Weapons]] - Can be thrown without ammunition
  * [[rpd:dart_item|Darts]] - Simple throwing projectiles
  * [[rpd:javelin_item|Javelins]] - Thrown spears with good range
  * [[rpd:boomerang_item|Boomerangs]] - Return after being thrown
  * [[rpd:shuriken_item|Shurikens]] - Fast-throwing throwing stars

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Range**: Ranged weapons have a maximum effective range (typically 4-8 cells)
  * **Accuracy**: Generally lower than melee weapons, but some have special accuracy bonuses
  * **Ammunition**: Bows and crossbows require ammunition (arrows, bolts) to function
  * **No Ammunition**: The [[rpd:huntress_class|Huntress]] class can use ranged weapons without consuming ammunition
  * **Line of Sight**: Requires clear line of sight to target

==== Strategy ====
  * Effective for whittling down tough enemies before engaging in melee
  * Useful for fighting dangerous enemies from safe positions
  * Critical for fighting enemies immune to physical attacks
  * Ammo management is important for bow users
  * Can be used to activate switches or other distant mechanisms

==== Combat with Ranged Weapons ====
Ranged combat works similarly to melee combat but with different accuracy calculations and range limitations. Ranged attacks can be affected by accuracy items like [[rpd:ring_of_accuracy_item|Ring of Accuracy]].
