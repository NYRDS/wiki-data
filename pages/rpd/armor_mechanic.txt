====== Armor Mechanic ======

Armor in Remixed Dungeon provides protection by reducing damage from physical attacks. Each piece of armor has a defense rating that contributes to the hero's overall survivability.

==== Armor Stats ====
  * **Defense Rating (DR)**: How much damage is reduced from incoming attacks
  * **Durability**: How much damage the armor can take before breaking
  * **Level/Upgrades**: Armor can be upgraded to improve its defense rating
  * **Speed Penalty**: Heavier armor may slow hero movement
  * **Stealth Penalty**: Heavier armor may reduce stealth effectiveness

  * [[rpd:cloth_armor_item|Cloth Armor]] - Lightest armor with minimal protection
  * [[rpd:leather_armor_item|Leather Armor]] - Balanced protection and mobility

==== Armor Mechanics ====
  * **Absorption**: Armor absorbs a percentage of incoming physical damage
  * **Durability**: All armor takes damage when absorbing hits and can break if not maintained
  * **Identification**: Most armor must be identified to show full stats
  * **Upgrading**: Armor can be upgraded using [[rpd:scroll_of_upgrade_item|Scroll of Upgrade]] or similar items
