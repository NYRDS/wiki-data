{{ rpd:images:item_PoisonArrow.png|Poison Arrow }}

**Poison Arrow** is a special ranged ammunition item in Remixed Pixel Dungeon that poisons enemies on hit.

==== Description ====
A wooden arrow with a head soaked in poison. When this arrow hits an enemy, it applies a poison status effect, causing continuous damage over time. This is created by "moistening" a Common Arrow with a Potion of Toxic Gas.

==== Stats ====
  * **Damage:** 1-3 points
  * **Delay:** 1.0x (relative to weapon firing speed)
  * **Durability:** Single use (consumed on impact)
  * **Price:** Cannot be purchased in shops; only created through moistening
  * **Weight:** 1

==== Properties ====
  * **Type:** Throwing/Ammunition (Special)
  * **Usage:** For use with ranged weapons like bows
  * **Consumable:** Each arrow is consumed after being shot
  * **Stackable:** Can stack up to very high quantities
  * **Special Effect:** Poisons the target on hit, causing damage over time

==== Creation ====
Poison Arrows can be created by using a [[rpd:potion_of_toxic_gas|Potion of Toxic Gas]] on regular [[rpd:common_arrow|Common Arrows]]. This process is called "moistening" and transforms the basic arrow into one with special properties.

==== Mechanics ====
  * When hitting an enemy, applies the Poison status effect
  * Poison causes 1 damage per turn until it wears off or enemy dies
  * Poison effect stacks with existing poison, refreshing duration
  * Does not stack with other status effects like Paralysis or Burning

==== Availability ====
  * **Creation Only:** Cannot be found as random loot; must be created by moistening
  * **Required Materials:** Common Arrow + Potion of Toxic Gas
  * **Alchemy:** Part of the game's alchemy system for creating special ammunition

==== Strategy ====
  * Excellent for dealing sustained damage without expending many resources
  * Good against enemies with moderate health that can be poisoned to death
  * Consider when facing groups, as poison will continue to weaken them over time
  * Be careful not to waste on enemies that can clear poison quickly or are immune
  * Effective against enemies that don't kill you immediately, allowing the poison to work

==== Notes ====
Poison Arrows are a key part of the alchemy system, allowing players to create powerful ammunition from common resources. They're particularly effective when fighting multiple enemies or in situations where you can maintain distance.
