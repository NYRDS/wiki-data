====== Stun ======

Stun is a status effect in Remixed Dungeon that prevents a character from taking any actions for a period of time. Despite its name, it functions very similarly to the [[rpd:paralysis|Paralysis]] effect.

==== Description ====
When a character is stunned, they are completely immobilized and unable to perform any actions until the effect wears off or is cured. This includes movement, attacking, using items, or casting spells.

==== Effects ====
  * **Action Prevention:** Stunned characters cannot take any actions
  * **Duration:** Standard duration is 10 turns, modified by resistance effects
  * **Vulnerability:** Stunned targets are vulnerable to attacks
  * **Automatic Recovery:** Effect ends automatically after time expires
  * **Visual Indicator:** Stunned characters display a specific status animation (CharSprite.State.PARALYSED)

==== Causes ====
  * [[rpd:paralysis|Paralysis Enchantment]] - Weapon enchantment that applies Stun (not Paralysis as the name suggests)
  * [[rpd:paralysis_arrow|Paralysis Arrow]] - Missile weapon that applies Stun effect, not Paralysis
  * [[rpd:air_elemental|Air Elemental]] - Can apply stun effect
  * Certain enemy attacks - Some creatures can stun with their attacks
  * Special spells - Some spells may cause stun

==== Immunities ====
Some creatures are immune to the Stun effect:
  * [[rpd:lich_mob|Lich]]
  * [[rpd:piranha|Piranha]]
  * [[rpd:undead_mobs|Undead creatures]] - Often have resistance or immunity
  * [[rpd:pasty_mimic|Pasty-Mimic]] - Immune to paralysis, toxic gas, and stun
  * [[rpd:warrior_armor|Warrior's Class Armor]] - Can apply stun to enemies (via Paralysis effect)

==== Countering the Effect ====
  * The effect will naturally wear off after the duration expires
  * [[rpd:ring_of_elements|Ring of Elements]] may provide resistance to reduce duration
  * Some items or abilities may remove negative status effects

==== Technical Details ====
  * **Java Class:** [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/watabou/pixeldungeon/actors/buffs/Stun.java|com.watabou.pixeldungeon.actors.buffs.Stun]]
  * **Default Duration:** 10 turns (DURATION constant)
  * **Visual State:** Uses CharSprite.State.PARALYSED state and BuffIndicator.PARALYSIS icon
  * **Implementation:** Extends FlavourBuff class and mimics Paralysis mechanics
  * **Mechanics:** Calls target.paralyse(true) to prevent actions when attached
