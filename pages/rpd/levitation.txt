{{ rpd:images:levitation_icon.png|Levitation }}

**Levitation** is a beneficial status effect in Remixed Dungeon that allows the affected character to float above the ground.

==== Effect Description ====
  * **Type:** Beneficial Status Effect (Buff)
  * **Effect:** Allows floating above ground level
  * **Duration:** 20 turns (standard duration)
  * **Source:** Primarily from drinking a [[rpd:potion_of_levitation|Potion of Levitation]]

==== How to Obtain ====
  * From drinking a [[rpd:potion_of_levitation|Potion of Levitation]]
  * From certain spells or class abilities
  * From special items or environmental effects

==== Mechanics ====
  * Allows movement over traps without triggering them
  * Enables passage over special terrain that would normally impede movement
  * Prevents certain ground-based effects from affecting the character
  * Blocks the Roots status effect (detaches any roots currently affecting the character)
  * When effect ends, the game calls Dungeon.level.press() which may trigger floor effects at the character's position

==== Strategy ====
  * Excellent for safely crossing trap-filled areas
  * Allows bypassing certain obstacles or difficult terrain
  * Useful for avoiding ground-based harmful effects
  * Good for navigating dangerous floor tiles
  * Timing the end of the effect is important to avoid landing in dangerous areas

==== Counters =====
  * Air-based attacks may still affect levitating characters
  * Some effects are not prevented by levitation
  * Effect ends automatically after 20 turns

==== Code Reference ====
  * Java Class: [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/watabou/pixeldungeon/actors/buffs/Levitation.java|Levitation.java]]
  * Source Code Location: RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/watabou/pixeldungeon/actors/buffs/Levitation.java
  * Duration is fixed at 20 turns; removes Roots when attached and calls press() when detached
