====== Battle Mage Armor ======

Battle Mage Armor is the class-specific armor obtained by using an [[rpd:armor_kit_item|Armor Kit]] on any regular armor for the [[rpd:battle_mage|Battle Mage]] subclass in Remixed Dungeon. This armor is functionally identical to [[rpd:warlock_armor_item|Warlock Armor]], but has a different appearance.

==== Acquisition ====
  * Use an [[rpd:armor_kit_item|Armor Kit]] on any regular armor while playing as a [[rpd:mage_class|Mage]] who has chosen the [[rpd:battle_mage|Battle Mage]] subclass
  * Transforms the base armor into Battle Mage Armor with special properties

==== Special Properties ====

  * Blast ability: Ignites and roots all visible enemies for 3 turns
  * Requires sufficient skill points to use special ability
  * Exclusive to the [[rpd:battle_mage|Battle Mage]] subclass - cannot be equipped if not the [[rpd:battle_mage|Battle Mage]] subclass

==== Usage ====
  * Essential armor for maximizing the effectiveness of the [[rpd:battle_mage|Battle Mage]] subclass
  * Should be crafted as soon as possible after choosing the [[rpd:battle_mage|Battle Mage]] subclass
