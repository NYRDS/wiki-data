====== Poison Arrow Item ======

{{ rpd:images:poison_arrow_item.png|Poison Arrow }}

**Poison Arrow** is a special ranged ammunition item in Remixed Pixel Dungeon that poisons enemies on hit.

==== Description ====
A wooden arrow with a head soaked in poison. When this arrow hits an enemy, it applies a poison status effect, causing continuous damage over time. This is created by "moistening" a Common Arrow with a [[rpd:potion_of_toxic_gas_item|Potion of Toxic Gas]].

==== Stats ====
  * **Damage:** 3-4 points (base, increases when fired from a bow)
  * **Delay:** 0.75x (relative to weapon firing speed)
  * **Accuracy:** 1x (relative to weapon accuracy)
  * **Required Strength:** 9
  * **Durability:** Single use (consumed on impact)
  * **Price:** 5 gold per arrow
  * **Weight:** 1

==== Properties ====
  * **Type:** Throwing/Ammunition (Special)
  * **Usage:** For use with ranged weapons like bows
  * **Consumable:** Each arrow is consumed after being shot
  * **Stackable:** Can stack up to very high quantities
  * **Special Effect:** Poisons the target on hit, causing damage over time
  * **Upgradable when fired:** Damage increases with the bow's level

==== Creation ====
Poison Arrows can be created by using a [[rpd:potion_of_toxic_gas_item|Potion of Toxic Gas]] on regular [[rpd:common_arrow_item|Common Arrows]]. This process is called "moistening" and transforms the basic arrow into one with special properties.

==== Mechanics ====
  * When hitting an enemy, applies the [[rpd:poison_buff|Poison]] status effect
  * Base poison duration is 5f (defined as ''PoisonArrow.DURATION = 5f''), increased by 1 turn per level of the bow it was fired from (if fired from a bow)
  * Poison causes 1 damage per turn until it wears off or enemy dies
  * Poison effect stacks with existing poison, refreshing duration
  * Does not stack with other status effects like [[rpd:paralysis_buff|Paralysis]] or [[rpd:burning_buff|Burning]]

==== Implementation Details ====
  * **Class**: ''com.watabou.pixeldungeon.items.weapon.missiles.PoisonArrow''
  * **Parent Class**: Extends ''Arrow'' class
  * **Sprite**: item_PoisonArrow.png
  * **Damage**: Min 3, Max 4 (updated in constructor)
  * **Delay**: Base delay 0.75 (updated in constructor)
  * **Price**: 5 gold per arrow (quantity-based)
  * **Poison Application**: Handled in the ''attackProc'' method using ''Buff.affect(defender, Poison.class, ...)''
  * **Poison Duration**: ''Poison.durationFactor(defender) * poisonFactor'' where poisonFactor = 1 + firedFrom.level() if fired from a bow
  * **Special Activation**: ''activateSpecial(attacker, defender, damage)'' is called before applying poison

==== Availability ====
  * **Creation Only:** Cannot be found as random loot; must be created by moistening
  * **Required Materials:** [[rpd:common_arrow_item|Common Arrow]] + [[rpd:potion_of_toxic_gas_item|Potion of Toxic Gas]]
  * **Alchemy:** Part of the game's alchemy system for creating special ammunition

==== Strategy ====
  * Excellent for dealing sustained damage without expending many resources
  * Good against enemies with moderate health that can be poisoned to death
  * Consider when facing groups, as poison will continue to weaken them over time
  * Be careful not to waste on enemies that can clear poison quickly or are immune
  * Effective against enemies that don't kill you immediately, allowing the poison to work
  * Damage increases when fired from a bow, and poison duration increases with the bow's level

==== Notes ====
Poison Arrows are a key part of the alchemy system, allowing players to create powerful ammunition from common resources. They're particularly effective when fighting multiple enemies or in situations where you can maintain distance. The poison effect has a base duration of 5 turns, with additional duration based on the level of the bow used to fire them.
