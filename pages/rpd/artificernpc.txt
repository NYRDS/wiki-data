{{ rpd:images:artificernpc_sprite.png|Artificer NPC }}

The **Artificer NPC** is an unused non-player character in Remixed Dungeon. Though a sprite and configuration file exist for this NPC, there appears to be no active code implementing this character in the game.

==== Description ====
The Artificer NPC exists in the game assets but appears to be non-functional. It has a sprite and configuration file but no active code implementation.

==== Assets ====
Based on the available assets:
  * Sprite: [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/assets/mobs/artificernpc.png|artificernpc.png]]
  * Configuration: [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/assets/spritesDesc/ArtificerNPC.json|ArtificerNPC.json]]

==== Status ====
  * The NPC is implemented in neither Java code nor Lua scripts
  * Exists as a sprite file and configuration only
  * Possibly a planned or removed feature from the game
  * May have been intended as a crafting or item modification specialist

==== Content Verification ====
