**Cooking** is a gameplay mechanic in Remixed Dungeon that allows players to transform certain items using a [[rpd:cauldron_level_object|Cauldron]].

==== Overview ====
Cooking is performed at a cauldron found in certain dungeon levels. Players can use the cauldron to safely process potentially dangerous items into useful ones.

==== Cookable Items ====
The primary use of cooking is to convert [[rpd:mystery_meat|Mystery Meat]] into [[rpd:chargrilled_meat_item|Chargrilled Meat]], which is safe to eat without the random effects of mystery meat.

==== Process ====
1. Find a [[rpd:cauldron_level_object|Cauldron]] in the dungeon
2. Approach the cauldron with the item to cook
3. Select the cooking option from the menu
4. The item will be transformed according to cooking recipes

==== Benefits ====
* **Safety:** Converts dangerous items (like mystery meat) into safe alternatives
* **Resource efficiency:** Allows players to make use of items that might otherwise be risky to consume
* **Inventory management:** Helps manage food items and prevent negative effects
