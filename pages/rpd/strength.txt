====== Strength ======

**Strength** is a primary attribute in Remixed Dungeon that determines a character's ability to wield equipment.

==== Description ====
Strength is a fundamental stat that determines how much equipment a character can effectively use. Each piece of equipment has a strength requirement, and using equipment with a higher requirement than your current strength will result in penalties.

==== Functions ====
  * **Equipment Requirement:** Determines what weapons and armor can be used effectively
  * **Penalties:** Using equipment above your strength requirement results in slower speed and attack rate
  * **Carrying Capacity:** Affects how much weight the character can carry without penalties

==== Equipment Requirements ====
  * **Weapons:** All weapons have strength requirements that increase with item level
  * **Armor:** All armor pieces have strength requirements that increase with armor level
  * **Rings:** Most rings don't have strength requirements

==== Effects of Insufficient Strength ====
  * **Slower Movement:** Character moves more slowly
  * **Slower Attacks:** Attack speed is reduced
  * **Reduced Effectiveness:** Equipment doesn't perform at full capacity

==== Increasing Strength ====
  * **Leveling Up:** Each level gives a chance to increase strength
  * **Rings:** Ring of Might provides gradual strength increase over time
  * **Items:** Some items can temporarily increase strength
  * **Starting Stats:** Different hero classes start with different strength values

==== Typical Strength Requirements ====
  * **Level 1 Weapon:** Usually requires 5-6 strength
  * **Level 1 Armor:** Usually requires 7-8 strength
  * **Higher-level items:** Requirements increase with item level

==== Strategy ====
  * **Planning:** Match equipment upgrades with strength increases
  * **Ring of Might:** Consider using Ring of Might to increase effective strength over time
  * **Timing:** Upgrade equipment when you have sufficient strength to use it effectively
  * **Balance:** Balance between getting stronger equipment and maintaining effectiveness
