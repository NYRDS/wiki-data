==== Description ====
Firebloom is a plant that explodes in a burst of flame when touched, dealing fire damage to the character that triggers it and all creatures in the adjacent area. When planted, it will immediately trigger its effect.

==== Effects ====
  * Creates a fire blob affecting the triggering cell and adjacent cells
  * Deals fire damage to all creatures in the affected area
  * Disappears after triggering
  * Produces a visual flame particle effect

==== Mechanics ====
  * Firebloom can be found growing in the dungeon or grown by planting [[rpd:firebloom_seed_item|Firebloom Seeds]]
  * Triggered when any character steps on the tile containing the plant
  * Creates a Fire blob with 2 intensity that lasts for several turns
  * Generates visual flame particle effects on activation

==== Strategy ====
  * Firebloom plants should generally be avoided unless used tactically in combat
  * They can be useful for damaging groups of enemies in tight spaces
  * Consider pushing enemies onto Firebloom plants when surrounded by hostile creatures
  * Be careful when using them, as they will damage you as well
