The Firebloom plant is a dangerous plant that deals fire damage to any character that touches it. When a character steps on the tile containing a Firebloom plant, it explodes and burns everything in the surrounding area.

  * Also damages all other creatures in the surrounding area
  * The plant disappears after being touched
  * Provides an explosive effect that can damage multiple enemies

==== Mechanics ====
  * Firebloom plants can be found growing in the dungeon
  * They can also be grown by planting [[rpd:firebloom_seed_item|Firebloom Seeds]]
  * The explosion affects a small radius around the plant location
  * Can be both a hazard and a tactical tool in combat

==== Strategy ====
  * Firebloom plants should generally be avoided unless used tactically in combat
