====== Sewers ======

The Sewers is the first major area of Remixed Dungeon, located directly beneath the city. These levels form the upper levels of the dungeon and serve as the starting area for most adventurers.

==== Description ====
The Sewers lie right beneath the City, their upper levels actually constitute the City's sewer system. Being nominally a part of the City, these levels are not that dangerous. No one will call it a safe place, but at least you won't need to deal with much evil magic here.
