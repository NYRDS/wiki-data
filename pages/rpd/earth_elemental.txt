Earth elementals are earth masses driven by concentrated nature forces. They can literally root you to the ground and cause regrowth in appropriate terrain.

==== Description ====
Earth elementals are made from earth and plants. They are heavily armored creatures with high HP but slower attack speed. They are immune to many status effects and can cause beneficial regrowth when attacking in certain terrains.

==== Stats ====
  * **HP**: Dungeon depth × 10 + 1
  * **Defense Skill**: Dungeon depth / 2 + 1
  * **Attack Skill**: (Base defense skill / 2) + 1
  * **Damage**: HP / 5 (both min and max)
  * **Damage Reduction**: Equal to experience for kill
  * **Exp for Kill**: Dungeon depth + 1
  * **Max Level**: Dungeon depth + 2
  * **Speed**: Normal speed, but 0.5x on liquid terrain
  * **Kind**: Determined by dungeon depth (kind = min(depth/5, 4))

==== Abilities ====
  * **Regrowth Attack**: Has a 50% chance to cause regrowth when attacking enemies on appropriate terrain
  * **Liquid Slow**: Moves at half speed when on liquid terrain
  * **Terrain Interaction**: Can cause regrowth when attacking on empty, ember, empty_deco, grass, or high_grass terrain
  * **Regrowth Amount**: Creates 15×(expForKill or 10) units of regrowth when triggering the ability

==== Immunities ====
  * [[rpd:roots|Roots]]
  * [[rpd:paralysis|Paralysis]]
  * [[rpd:stun|Stun]]
  * [[rpd:toxic_gas|Toxic Gas]]
  * [[rpd:burning|Burning]]
  * [[rpd:bleeding|Bleeding]]

==== Drops ====
  * [[rpd:earthroot_seed|Seed of Earthroot]] (10% chance)

==== Behavior ====
  * Adjusts stats based on dungeon depth through the IDepthAdjustable interface
  * Speed is reduced to half when on liquid terrain (water, lava, etc.)
  * When attacking, has a 50% chance to cause regrowth on appropriate terrain types
  * The regrowth effect can create favorable terrain for the Earth Elemental and hinder player mobility

==== Strategy ====
  * Fight in non-vegetation terrain to prevent the regrowth effect
  * Use liquid terrain to your advantage, as Earth Elementals move slower there
  * Avoid standing on grass or other vegetation when fighting Earth Elementals
  * Be prepared for the Earth Elemental to potentially create advantageous terrain for itself
  * The high HP and damage reduction make these enemies quite durable
