The Black Skull is an ancient artifact created by one of the first Necromancers. It is used by the [[rpd:lich_mob|Lich]] boss to raise dead monsters to serve the player. This artifact is found in the Necropolis area in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Description ====
The Black Skull is a small obsidian skull that was the source of the Necropolis powers, but after the Lich's defeat it seems to have lost all its powers. However, when you hold it in your hands a strange thought crosses your mind: "It hungers". When awakened, the skull can raise dead monsters to serve the player.

==== Special Mechanics ====
  * **Awakening**: The Black Skull can be awakened to gain special abilities
  * **Resurrection**: An awakened Black Skull can raise dead monsters to serve the player
  * **Necromancy Focus**: It serves as a focal point for necromantic abilities

==== Black Skull of Mastery ====
The [[rpd:lich_mob|Lich]] boss may also drop the [[rpd:the_soulbringer|The Soulbringer]], also known as the Black Skull of Mastery. This item allows a [[rpd:necromancer|Necromancer]] to become a [[rpd:lich|Lich]] subclass by consuming the power of both the spell and the artifact itself.
