====== Black Skull ======

{{ rpd:images:item_BlackSkull.png|Black Skull }}

The Black Skull is an artifact in Remixed Dungeon that can be awakened to raise defeated monsters to serve the player.

==== Description ====
A small obsidian skull. It was the source of the Necropolis powers, but after the Lich's defeat it seems to have lost all its powers. However, when you hold it in your hands a strange thought crosses your mind: "It hungers".

==== Special Mechanics ====
  * **Dormant State**: Initially the skull does nothing special but begins charging when monsters die near you
  * **Awakening**: After 10 monsters die near you while carrying the skull, it awakens
  * **Resurrection**: When awakened, the skull can resurrect defeated monsters as pets that fight for you
  * **Charge Consumption**: Each resurrection costs 10 charges of the skull
  * **Deactivation**: If the skull runs out of charges after resurrection, it becomes dormant again
  * **Pet Protection**: Pets resurrected by the skull are immune to Paralysis

==== Stats ====
  * **Rarity**: Artifact
  * **Class**: Artifact
  * **Max Charge**: 10 (to awaken)
  * **Resurrection Cost**: 10 charges
  * **Related Class**: [[rpd:necromancer_class|Necromancer]]

==== Acquisition ====
  * Dropped by the [[rpd:lich_mob|Lich]] boss in Necropolis (distinct from the Black Skull of Mastery)
  * Different from the [[rpd:black_skull_of_mastery_item|Black Skull of Mastery]] which is used for subclass selection

==== Behavior ====
  * Collects charges when allied creatures (pets) die near the hero
  * When awakened, automatically resurrects defeated monsters that are eligible to become pets
  * The awakened skull has a different appearance (image index 20 instead of 19)

==== Strategy ====
  * Allow monsters to die near you to charge the skull (requires 10 deaths to awaken)
  * Once awakened, the skull will automatically resurrect compatible monsters as pets
  * Each resurrection costs 10 charges; if charges reach 0, the skull deactivates
  * Focus on monsters that can become useful pets for your play style
