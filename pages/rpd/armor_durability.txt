====== Armor Durability ======

Armor Durability is a system in Remixed Dungeon that causes armor to degrade with use over time, eventually reducing its effectiveness.

==== Description ====
Armor Durability is a mechanic that causes armor to degrade each time it absorbs damage. As durability decreases, the armor's effectiveness may be reduced until it eventually breaks completely.

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Degradation Rate:** Armor degrades when it absorbs damage from attacks
  * **Protection Reduction:** As durability decreases, armor may provide less protection
  * **Complete Failure:** When durability reaches zero, the armor may break completely or become ineffective

==== Implementation ====
  * **Base Class:** [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/watabou/pixeldungeon/items/armor/Armor.java|Armor.java]]
  * **Durability Tracking:** Integrated into the base Armor class
  * **Damage Absorption:** [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/watabou/pixeldungeon/items/armor/Armor.java#L136|Armor absorb() method]]
