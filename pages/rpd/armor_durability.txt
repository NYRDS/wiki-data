====== Armor Durability ======

Armor durability is the system that governs how armor degrades with use in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Description ====
Armor durability represents how much wear and tear an armor piece has sustained. As armor is used in combat and exploration, it slowly degrades until it eventually breaks and becomes unusable.

==== Durability Mechanics ====
  * **Degradation Rate**: Armor slowly loses durability during gameplay
  * **Combat Degradation**: Taking and dealing damage contributes to durability loss
  * **Time-Based Loss**: Some minor degradation occurs over time
  * **Breakage**: When durability reaches zero, the armor breaks and is destroyed

==== Factors Affecting Durability ====
  * **Combat Frequency**: More combat results in faster degradation
  * **Damage Taken**: Higher damage taken accelerates degradation
  * **Damage Dealt**: Dealing damage also contributes to wear
  * **Armor Type**: Different armor types may have different durability properties

==== Durability Management ====
  * **Monitoring**: Keep track of armor durability to avoid unexpected breakage
  * **Replacement**: Plan for armor replacement when durability is low
  * **Upgrading**: Higher-level armor typically has better durability
  * **Backup Plans**: Consider having spare armor for important expeditions

==== Durability Preservation ====
  * **Avoiding Combat**: Reducing unnecessary fights can preserve armor
  * **Efficient Combat**: Finishing fights quickly may reduce overall wear
  * **Alternative Protection**: Using buffs and other defenses when possible
  * **Strategic Upgrades**: Upgrading armor may extend its effective lifespan
