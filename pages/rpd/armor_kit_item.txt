{{ rpd:images:armor_kit_item.png|Armor Kit }}

==== Description ====
The **Armor Kit** is a unique item that allows the hero to upgrade their current armor to a special class armor that is tailored to their hero class and subclass. This provides additional benefits when compared to regular armor upgrades.

==== Usage ====
* Use the Armor Kit on any armor of level 1 or higher to transform it into a class armor
* The resulting class armor will have the same level as the original armor
* Class armors provide special abilities when the hero has a certain amount of health

==== Special Abilities ====
Each class armor has a unique special ability that activates when the hero's health is below a certain threshold (usually 50%):

  * **Warrior Armor (Gladiator)**: Throws a stone at enemies, dealing damage equal to 200% of the hero's strength
  * **Mage Armor (Battlemage)**: Performs a soul strike that deals damage equal to 200% of the hero's strength and inflicts burning
  * **Rogue Armor (Freerunner)**: Creates a smoke bomb that blinds all nearby enemies for 3 turns
  * **Huntress Armor (Sniper)**: Performs a precise shot that deals 200% of hero's strength as damage with 50% accuracy bonus
  * **Elf Armor (Shaman)**: Summons a friendly Spirit Wolf for 20 turns
  * **Necromancer Armor (Witch Doctor)**: Summons a friendly Deathling for 20 turns
  * **Gnoll Armor (Guardian)**: Creates a shield that reduces physical damage by 50% for 5 turns

==== Availability ====
* Found in the Demon Halls as a reward for completing the level
* May also appear in rare treasure locations
