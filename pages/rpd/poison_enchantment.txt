The **Poison Enchantment** is a weapon enchantment in Remixed Dungeon that has a chance to apply the [[rpd:poison|Poison]] status effect to enemies when they are hit by the weapon.

==== Effect ====
When attacking an enemy, the Poison Enchantment has a chance to apply the Poison status effect:
  * **Level 0:** 33% chance to poison for (level + 1) turns
  * **Level 1:** 50% chance to poison for (level + 1) turns  
  * **Level 2:** 60% chance to poison for (level + 1) turns
  * Higher levels increase both the chance and duration of poisoning

==== Mechanics ====
  * The poison duration is affected by the target's resistance (e.g., from [[rpd:ring_of_elements_item|Ring of Elements]])
  * The effect applies to both melee and ranged weapons
  * Multiple applications refresh the poison duration rather than stacking
  * Poison causes (time remaining / 3) + 1 damage per turn

==== Application ====
  * Applied randomly when upgrading weapons with a [[rpd:scroll_of_weapon_upgrade|Scroll of Weapon Upgrade]]
  * Can appear on any weapon type (melee, ranged, thrown)
  * Higher-level weapons will have stronger enchantment effects

==== Strategy ====
  * Particularly effective on high-attack-speed weapons to consistently apply poison
  * Works well with weapons that have lower base damage but good enchantment potential
  * Effective against enemies that take time to defeat, as they'll take continuous damage
  * Can be especially powerful in groups of enemies where they might spread poison to each other
  * Synergizes well with other DoT (damage over time) effects
