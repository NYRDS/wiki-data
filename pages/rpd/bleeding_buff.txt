{{ rpd:images:bleeding_buff.png|Bleeding }}

**Bleeding** is a harmful status effect in Remixed Dungeon that causes continuous damage over time. Characters affected by bleeding will take damage each turn until the effect wears off or is cured.

==== Effect ====
  * **Damage**: 1 point of damage per turn, plus 10% of max HP (rounded down)
  * **Duration**: Varies depending on the source of the bleeding
  * **Turn-based**: Damage occurs at the start of the affected character's turn

==== Sources ====
  * [[rpd:albino_rat_mob|Albino Rat]] - Common source of bleeding, especially in early game
  * [[rpd:chill_buff|Chill]] - When frozen units move, they take bleed damage
  * [[rpd:acidic_mob|Acidic Scorpio]] - Can inflict bleeding with ranged attacks
  * Various weapons with bleeding enchantments
  * Certain traps and environmental effects

==== Immunities ====
  * [[rpd:dm300_mob|DM-300]] and other mechanical enemies are immune to bleeding
  * Some other mechanical and construct-type enemies may be immune

==== Curing ====
  * [[rpd:potion_of_healing_item|Potion of Healing]] - Cures all status effects including bleeding
  * [[rpd:wand_of_regrowth|Wand of Regrowth]] - May cure bleeding effects
  * [[rpd:ring_of_mending|Ring of Mending]] - May occasionally heal bleeding damage
  * Certain class abilities and items that provide healing

==== Strategy ====
  * Bleeding damage can be very dangerous, especially if it stacks from multiple sources
  * Prioritize curing bleeding with healing potions or other means
  * Be cautious when facing albino rats and other bleeding-inducing enemies
  * In longer battles, bleeding can be more dangerous than direct attacks

==== Notes ====
  * The damage calculation (1 + 10% max HP) means bleeding is more dangerous for enemies with high HP
  * Bleeding damage is dealt before other actions on the character's turn
  * Some characters have abilities that make them particularly vulnerable or resistant to bleeding
