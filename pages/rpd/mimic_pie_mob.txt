Mimic Pie is a magical creature that disguises itself as a large, delicious-looking pasty to trick adventurers. It is a variant of the Mimic mob that takes the form of food instead of treasure chests.

==== Description ====
In Remixed PD, mimics can sometimes take the appearance of a big and delicious Pasty. They can even hide in chests or on rare occasions inside of a chest-mimic. On top of that, these creatures can fly.

==== Properties ====
  * **HP**: (3 + current level depth) * 5
  * **Attack Skill**: 9 + current level depth
  * **Defense Skill**: 2 * attack skill / 3
  * **Damage**: hp/10 to hp/4
  * **EXP**: 2 + 2 * (current level depth - 1) / 5
  * **Speed**: 1.25 (faster than normal)
  * **Flight**: Yes (can fly over obstacles)

==== Special Abilities ====
  * **Flight**: Can fly over all types of terrain and obstacles
  * **Mimic Behavior**: Disguises as food to trick players
  * **Rotten Pasty Drop**: Carries a Rotten Pasty in its inventory
  * **Gas Immunity**: Immune to Toxic Gas, Paralysis and Stun effects
  * **No Corpse**: Does not leave a carcass upon death (carcassChance = 0)

==== Mechanics ====
  * The Mimic Pie flies and can move over all types of terrain and obstacles
  * Immune to gas-based attacks (Toxic Gas), paralysis, and stun effects
  * Starts with the Rotten Pasty already in its inventory
  * Stats scale with dungeon depth similar to other enemies
  * When the mimic activates, it doesn't take off at once; if a Mimic Pie appears on a trap or a plant - their flying ability will be activated immediately
  * When this mob activates, the attack button does not appear immediately, but only after clicking once on the screen

==== Strategy ====
  * **Identification**: Be cautious when finding unattended food items in the dungeon, as they may be mimics in disguise
  * **Attack Pattern**: Unlike other enemies, Mimic Pie doesn't behave passively - it will actively hunt the player once activated
  * **Immunities**: Cannot be affected by gas-based attacks, paralysis, or stun effects
  * **Loot**: Will always drop a [[rpd:rotten_food|Rotten Pasty]] upon death, which can be eaten but provides no nutritional value
  * Be cautious around unattended food items in the dungeon, as they may be Mimic Pies in disguise
  * Since it can fly, terrain advantages are less effective against it
  * Gas-based attacks, paralysis, and stun effects won't work against this mob

==== Technical Details ====
  * **Java Class**: [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/watabou/pixeldungeon/actors/mobs/MimicPie.java|MimicPie.java]]
  * **Implementation**: Extends the base Mob class and implements IDepthAdjustable interface
  * **AI State**: Initially passive until triggered, then switches to Hunting behavior
  * **Depth Scaling**: Stats automatically adjust based on dungeon level depth

==== Related Mobs ====
  * [[rpd:mimic|Chest Mimic]] - The more common variant that disguises as treasure chests
  * [[rpd:mimicamulet|Mimic Amulet]] - Another variant of mimic mob

==== Notes ====
Mimic Pie appears as a food item but is actually an enemy. Be careful when finding unattended food items in the dungeon, as they may be mimics in disguise.
