**Heal** is a spell in Remixed Pixel Dungeon with Witchcraft Affinity (also available to Priest and PlagueDoctor affinities).

==== Description ====
The Heal spell restores a portion of the target's health instantly, making it valuable for emergency situations. The healing amount is calculated as 20% of the target's max HP multiplied by the caster's skill level (with a minimum of 1 HP healed).

==== Stats ====
  * **Magic Affinity:** [[rpd:witchcraft_affinity|Witchcraft]] (also available in [[rpd:priest_class|Priest]] and [[rpd:plague_doctor_affinity|Plague Doctor]] affinities)
  * **Targeting:** Char (can target any character on the map)
  * **Level:** 2
  * **Mana Cost:** 5
  * **Cast Time:** 1 turn
  * **Cooldown:** 2 turns

==== Mechanics ====
The spell heals the target character for (Max HP / 5 * Caster's skill level) hit points, with a minimum of 1 point healed, according to the Lua implementation.

The exact formula from the Lua code is: heal = target:ht() / 5. * caster:skillLevel()

This means that for a full-health target:
  * At caster skill level 1: heals 20% of target's max HP (minimum 1)
  * At caster skill level 2: heals 40% of target's max HP (minimum 1)
  * At caster skill level 3: heals 60% of target's max HP (minimum 1)
  * And so on...

==== Usage ====
The Heal spell can be used for:
  * Emergency health restoration during dangerous encounters
  * Healing yourself in combat situations
  * Healing allies or pets
  * Supporting pets during challenging fights

==== Strategy ====
  * Best used when health is critically low
