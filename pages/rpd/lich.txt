The Lich class is achieved by using a [[rpd:black_skull_of_mastery|Black Skull of Mastery]] as a Necromancer. This transformation grants powerful necromantic abilities but reduces physical combat effectiveness. The [[rpd:lich_mob|Lich boss]] drops a Black Skull of Mastery when defeated by a Necromancer character.
