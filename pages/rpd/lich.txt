====== Lich ======

==== Description ====
The Lich is an advanced form of the Necromancer class. It's a necromancer who has reached the pinnacle of his abilities, existing between life and death.

==== Starting Perks ====
  * **Necromancy Mastery:** Exists between life and death, excelling in necromancy
  * **Reduced Combat Skills:** Combat skills are greatly lower than those of an ordinary person
  * **Soul Capacity:** Soul capacity is doubled compared to regular necromancers
  * **Strength Penalty:** Loses strength points upon becoming a Lich

==== Special Abilities ====
  * **Necrotism:** Can use the "Necrotism" ability which spreads a magic plague that may infect any creature in the vicinity, dead or alive
  * **Death Rejection:** Powers reject death itself, but causes loss of collected souls and possessions
  * **Enhanced Undead Control:** Superior control over undead minions

==== Notes ====
The Lich class is achieved by using a Black Skull of Mastery as a Necromancer. This transformation grants powerful necromantic abilities but reduces physical combat effectiveness.
