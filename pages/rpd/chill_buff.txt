====== Chill Buff ======

{{ rpd:images:chill_buff.png|Chill Buff }}

Chill is a status effect in Remixed Dungeon that reduces a character's speed and may have other effects.

==== Effect ====
When affected by the Chill effect:
  * **Reduced Speed:** Movement speed is decreased by a certain percentage
  * **Duration:** The effect lasts for a specific duration
  * **Stacking:** May stack with other movement-impairing effects to a limited extent

==== Application ====
The Chill effect can be applied through various sources:
  * [[rpd:wand_of_frost_item|Wand of Frost]] - Sometimes applies chill instead of full freezing
  * [[rpd:potion_of_frost_item|Potion of Frost]] - May cause chill in weaker forms
  * [[rpd:ice_elemental_mob|Ice Elementals]] - Attacks may chill characters
  * [[rpd:ice_trap_level_object|Ice Traps]] - May apply chill instead of full freeze
  * Cold-based attacks from various enemies

==== Mechanics ====
  * Speed reduction is typically around 50% of normal speed
  * The effect wears off over time or can be cleared by certain means
  * Unlike [[rpd:frost_buff|Frost]], characters can still act while chilled but more slowly

==== Strategic Considerations ====
  * **Benefits for enemies:** Can slow down fast-moving characters making them easier to fight
  * **Risks:** May allow enemies to catch up to the player more easily
  * **Counters:** Fire-based attacks or items can clear chill effects
