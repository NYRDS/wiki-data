====== Chill Buff ======

{{ rpd:images:chill_buff.png|Chill Status Effect }}

The **Chill** buff is a status effect in Remixed Dungeon that reduces the target's movement speed and possibly deals damage over time. It's typically caused by ice-based attacks or environmental effects.

==== Effects ====
  * **Reduced Movement Speed**: Affected characters move slower for the duration of the effect
  * **Possible Damage**: May deal minor cold damage over time
  * **Duration**: The effect lasts for a limited number of turns before expiring

==== Causes ====
  * [[rpd:ice_elemental_mob|Ice Elemental]] attacks
  * [[rpd:wand_of_icebolt_item|Wand of Icebolt]]
  * [[rpd:ice_magic|Ice Magic]] spells
  * Environmental effects in [[rpd:ice_caves|Ice Caves]]

==== Resistance ====
  * [[rpd:ring_of_elements|Ring of Elements]] provides partial resistance
  * [[rpd:fire_resistance|Fire Resistance]] can help mitigate chill effects
  * Certain armor and enchantments may provide protection against chill

==== Countering ====
  * Using fire-based items or abilities can often remove chill effects
  * [[rpd:potion_of_fire_item|Potion of Fire]] may help counter chill
  * Staying in warm areas may reduce duration

==== Strategy ====
  * **For Players**: Keep fire-based items handy when exploring cold areas
  * **For Enemies**: Chill can be an effective way to slow fast-moving enemies
  * **Duration**: The effect will naturally expire, so it's not permanently debilitating
