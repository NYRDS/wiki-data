====== Chaos Shield Left Buff ======

The Chaos Shield Left Buff is a status effect related to the [[rpd:chaos_shield_item|Chaos Shield]] item. It represents one half of the two-part Chaos Shield system.

==== Mechanics ====
  * The buff has two states: "ready" and "not ready"
  * When ready, it can block the next incoming attack (based on chance)
  * After blocking, it transitions to the "not ready" state
  * The buff automatically recharges over time until it's ready again
  * The Chaos Shield is split into two parts: left (this buff) and right (another buff)

==== Effects ====
  * **Shield Ready**: When in the ready state, has a chance to block incoming attacks reducing damage taken
  * **Shield Not Ready**: When not ready, the buff is in a cooldown state and cannot block attacks
  * **Damage Reduction**: When blocking occurs, damage is reduced based on the shield's level

==== Activation ====
  * Applied when using the [[rpd:chaos_shield_item|Chaos Shield]] item
  * Part of the two-part shield system created when fusing Chaos Staff with an item
