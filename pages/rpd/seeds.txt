===== Seeds =====
Seeds work a bit different in [[rpd:start|Remixed Pixel Dungeon]]. The main difference from the original game is that you can eat them. You will gain buffs from the seeds as soon as you eat one of them. Note that there is no general warrior health regeneration mechanic from eating seeds.

Seeds are collectible items that can be planted in the dungeon to grow various useful plants. They play an important role in the game's alchemy and farming systems.

==== Effects When Eaten ====
Here are all the effects you can gain, for eating different kinds of seeds:

  * **Fadeleaf**: Teleports the hero to a random spot in the dungeon and applies the «Vertigo» debuff for 20 turns. It is better to plant the seed and step on the plant, as you won't get the Vertigo debuff if you step on the plant.

  * **Sorrowmoss**: Applies the «Poison» debuff for a number of turns equal to player's level, and «Invisibility» buff for 2 turns.
