====== Necropolis ======

The **Necropolis** is one of the special branch dungeons in Remixed Pixel Dungeon, focused on undead-themed content.

==== Overview ====
The Necropolis is accessed from depth 7 of the main dungeon (Prison level) via a special exit that appears in the level. It consists of 4 regular levels (necro1-necro4) and a boss level (necro5). It features unique undead enemies and mechanics related to death and necromancy.

==== Access ====
To access the Necropolis, players must reach depth 7 (Prison level) where a [[rpd:necromancernpc|Necromancer NPC]] will spawn (unless the player is playing as the [[rpd:necromancer|Necromancer]] class) and give the player a [[rpd:skeleton_key|Skeleton Key]]. The Necropolis entrance appears as a locked exit on the Prison level (depth 7).

==== Levels ====
  * **necro1** (depth 8) - Entry level with basic undead creatures
  * **necro2** (depth 9) - More challenging undead with some elite enemies
  * **necro3** (depth 10) - Advanced undead enemies and mechanics
  * **necro4** (depth 11) - Most challenging regular area
  * **necro5** (depth 12) - Boss level with the [[rpd:lich_mob|Lich]] as the final encounter

==== Enemies ====
The Necropolis contains unique undead enemies not found elsewhere in the dungeon:
  * [[rpd:zombie|Zombie]]
  * [[rpd:skeleton|Skeleton]]
  * [[rpd:enslaved_soul|Enslaved Soul]]
  * [[rpd:exploding_skull|Exploding Skull]]
  * [[rpd:death_knight|Death Knight]]
  * [[rpd:dread_knight|Dread Knight]]
  * [[rpd:lich_mob|Lich]] (boss)
  * [[rpd:runicskull|Runic Skull]] (boss component)

==== Items and Rewards ====
  * [[rpd:black_skull_of_mastery|Black Skull of Mastery]] - Dropped by the Lich boss, required to become a [[rpd:lich|Lich subclass]]
  * [[rpd:soul_reaper|Soul Reaper]] - Special artifact for [[rpd:necromancer|Necromancer]] class, dropped by the Lich boss
  * [[rpd:blade_of_souls|Blade of Souls]] - Special weapon found in the Necropolis
  * [[rpd:jar_of_souls|Jar of Souls]] - Spawns on each Necropolis level

==== Strategy ====
The Necropolis requires preparation for undead-specific challenges. Many undead enemies have resistances to common damage types and may require specialized equipment or tactics to defeat effectively. The [[rpd:necromancer|Necromancer]] class has significant advantages when exploring this area due to their natural affinity with undead creatures.
