Regrowth is a blob effect in Remixed Dungeon that causes high grass to grow in an area, immobilizing creatures within it.

==== Description ====
Regrowth is an environmental effect that transforms the terrain by causing grass to grow rapidly. It's primarily created by special abilities and items that affect the dungeon environment.

==== Effects ====
When regrowth occurs in an area:
  * **Grass Generation:** High grass grows rapidly in the affected area
  * **Immobilization:** All creatures in the area become temporarily immobilized
  * **Environmental Change:** The terrain permanently changes to grass

  * [[rpd:wand_of_regrowth_item|Wand of Regrowth]] - Direct spell effect
  * [[rpd:regrowth_spell|Regrowth Spell]] - If it exists
  * Special abilities of nature-themed enemies

==== Mechanics ====
  * When activated, creates a large area filled with regrowth
  * Affects all creatures in the line of sight of the user
