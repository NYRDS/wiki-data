====== Gnoll Brute ======

{{ rpd:images:brute_sprite.png|Gnoll Brute }}

The **Gnoll Brute** is a stronger variant of the standard [[rpd:gnoll_mob|Gnoll]] that appears later in the dungeon.

==== Properties ====
  * **Type:** Enemy
  * **Level:** Mid-dungeon
  * **HP:** Higher than regular Gnolls
  * **Attack:** Stronger than regular Gnolls
  * **Defense:** Better than regular Gnolls
  * **Special:** When healed by a Gnoll player with the town Healer, this unlocks the Guardian subclass

==== Behavior ====
  * More aggressive than regular Gnolls
  * Higher damage output and health
  * Generally found deeper in the dungeon than regular Gnolls

==== Special Interaction ====
  * **Gnoll Subclass Unlock:** The Gnoll Brute plays a crucial role in unlocking the [[rpd:guardian|Guardian]] subclass for the Gnoll hero class
  * When a Gnoll player finds a Gnoll Brute, defeats it (without killing it completely), and brings it to the Healer NPC in town to be healed, this triggers the [[rpd:gnoll_unlocked|Gnoll Unlocked]] badge
  * This mechanic allows Gnoll players to unlock the Guardian subclass, which is otherwise not available through the traditional [[rpd:tome_of_mastery|Tome of Mastery]]

==== Strategy ====
  * For Gnoll players: Look for Gnoll Brute to unlock the Guardian subclass
  * For other players: Be cautious as Brutes are more challenging than regular Gnolls
  * The Brute may be encountered in groups with other Gnolls
