{{ rpd:images:enchant_luck.png|Luck Enchantment }}

==== Description ====
The Luck enchantment can deal additional damage with each hit. The effect is based on the weapon's level and provides a chance for extra damage beyond the normal attack damage.

==== Mechanics ====
- Each hit has a chance to deal additional damage based on the weapon's level
- For each level of the weapon, it makes an additional damage roll that could exceed the original damage
- The higher the weapon level, the more potential for additional damage
- The effect is variable and not guaranteed to increase damage every hit

==== Technical Details ====
- Additional damage = max(0, attacker.damageRoll() - i) for i from 1 to (weapon level + 1)
- This means it tries multiple times to exceed the original damage, taking the highest extra damage value
- The calculation is: for each level+1 attempts, it takes the maximum damage that exceeds the original damage by i points
