The Battle Mage is the Mage's subclass in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Unlocking ====
The Battle Mage subclass can be unlocked by using a [[rpd:tome_of_mastery|Tome of Mastery]] after defeating the second boss (Tengu).

==== Special Mechanics ====
When fighting with a wand in his hands, the _Battlemage_ inflicts additional damage equal to the current number of charges AND restores 1 charge to the wand if it's below maximum capacity.

==== Special Armor ====
Using an [[rpd:armor_kit|Armor Kit]] on any armor will transform it into the [[rpd:battle_mage_armor|Battle Mage Armor]], which is specifically designed for this subclass.

==== Advantages ====
  * Additional damage based on wand charges (damage bonus = current charges)
  * Wand charges are restored with each successful hit
  * Provides excellent wand sustainability
  * Synergizes well with all wands
  * Enables effective wand combat in close quarters

==== Disadvantages ====
  * Requires using wands to be effective
  * Less effective with melee weapons
  * Wand dependency for the subclass abilities
