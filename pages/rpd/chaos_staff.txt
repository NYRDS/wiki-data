====== Chaos Staff ======

Earned by fusing a [[Chaos Crystal]] with at least 50 charges with a wand. 

The staff will be unidentified and always have 2/2 charges. Upon attacking enemies a few times, will add spell combos upon the staff followed by repeatedly upgrading the weapon every few tiers (+1,+2 etc.) as well as further adding effects. 

It is recommended that if there is a specific enchantment desired, save the game and then monster hunt until the desired combo is reached.
