**Gladiator Armor** is the upgraded form of [[rpd:warrior_armor|Warrior Armor]] for the Warrior class, obtained when the Warrior subclass is unlocked and equipped.

==== Overview ====
Gladiator Armor is the advanced form of [[rpd:warrior_armor|Warrior Armor]] that becomes available when the Warrior character chooses the Gladiator subclass. It enhances the Heroic Leap ability of the Warrior Armor and provides additional combat benefits.

==== Special Ability: Cleave ====
  * **Effect**: When attacking an enemy, the Gladiator's weapon can potentially hit additional nearby enemies
  * **Mechanism**: After a successful hit, there's a chance to strike another adjacent enemy with reduced damage (50% of the original damage)
  * **Chain**: The cleaving attack can continue to another adjacent target, with damage reducing by half each time
  * **Limitation**: Cannot hit the same target twice in one cleaving sequence
  * **Chance**: The chance to cleave increases with armor level

==== Creation ====
  * Requires: [[rpd:warrior_armor|Warrior Armor]] (crafted with Armor Kit) + Warrior subclass selection
  * Character: Only available to Warrior characters who select the Gladiator subclass
  * Method: Automatically upgrades Warrior Armor when Gladiator subclass is chosen

==== Benefits ====
  * Maintains the Heroic Leap ability of Warrior Armor
  * Adds the powerful Cleave ability for area combat
  * Excellent for fighting groups of enemies
  * Combines mobility and area damage effectively

==== Strategy ====
Gladiator Armor is particularly effective when fighting groups of enemies:
  * Position yourself adjacent to multiple enemies to maximize cleave potential
  * Use Heroic Leap to position yourself optimally for cleaving
  * The higher the armor level, the higher the chance to cleave
  * Combine with high-damage weapons to maximize cleave effectiveness
