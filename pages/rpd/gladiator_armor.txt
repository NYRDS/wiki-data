{{ rpd:images:item_GladiatorArmor.png|Gladiator Armor }}

Gladiator Armor is the class-specific armor obtained by using an Armor Kit on any regular armor for the Gladiator subclass in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Acquisition ====
  * Use an [[rpd:armorkit|Armor Kit]] on any regular armor while playing as a character who has chosen the Gladiator subclass
  * Transforms the base armor into Gladiator Armor with special properties
  * The armor retains all properties of the original armor (defense, enchantment, level) but provides subclass-specific abilities

==== Special Properties ====
  * Inherits all properties of the original armor (defense value, enchantment, level)
  * Provides the Leap ability of Warrior Armor
  * Leap ability: Allows the wearer to jump to a targeted location, stunning adjacent enemies for 3 turns
  * Requires skill points to use special ability (skill point cost = max skill points / 3 + 1)
  * Exclusive to the Gladiator subclass - can only be equipped by the Gladiator subclass

==== Usage ====
  * Essential armor for maximizing the effectiveness of the Gladiator subclass
  * Should be crafted as soon as possible after choosing the Gladiator subclass
  * Allows full utilization of subclass abilities
  * Obtained by using the Armor Kit (found in City level, dropped by King boss) on any regular armor

==== Special Ability: Leap ====
  * Allows jumping to a targeted location
  * Stuns adjacent enemies for 3 turns upon landing (as defined in [[code:RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/watabou/pixeldungeon/items/armor/WarriorArmor.java#L11|WarriorArmor.java:11]])
  * Requires skill points to activate
  * Can be used to reposition in combat or escape dangerous situations
  * Action: "SPECIAL" when equipped
