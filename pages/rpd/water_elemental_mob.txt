**Water Elementals** are fluid and adaptive enemies found in flooded areas and deeper levels of Remixed Dungeon.

==== Description ====
Water Elementals are creatures of living water with unique properties. They can heal in liquid environments and adapt their behavior based on the surrounding terrain. These enemies are particularly dangerous near water sources.

  * **Level:** 9
  * **Health:** 22
  * **Attack:** 9-18
  * **Defense:** 7
  * **Speed:** 1.0 (normal)
  * **Resistances:** [[rpd:fire|Fire]]-based attacks, [[rpd:poison_buff|Poison]], [[rpd:bleeding_buff|Bleeding]]
  * **Vulnerabilities:** [[rpd:freezing|Freezing]] effects, [[rpd:electricity|Electricity]]

==== Special Abilities ====
  * **Regeneration:** Heals when standing in water
  * **Amphibious:** Moves normally through water without slowing
  * **Fluid Form:** Can squeeze through tight spaces and move past some obstacles
  * **Wet Effect:** Attacks may apply a 'wet' debuff that reduces fire resistance

==== Loot ====

  * Avoid fighting near water sources where they heal
