==== Description ====
**Water Elementals** are hostile creatures found in Remixed Dungeon. They are water-based enemies that exhibit different behaviors based on terrain and can freeze enemies on attack.

==== Stats ====
  * **HP:** (depth * 5 + 1)
  * **HT:** (depth * 5 + 1)
  * **Defense Skill:** depth * 2 + 1
  * **Attack Skill:** (depth * 2 + 1) / 2 + 1
  * **Damage:** (ht/2)-(ht/2) (fixed range)
  * **DR (Damage Reduction):** expForKill / 3
  * **EXP for Kill:** depth + 1
  * **Max Level:** depth + 2
  * **Carcass Chance:** 0
  * **Kind:** Math.min(depth/5, 4) (affects sprite appearance)

==== Special Abilities ====
  * **Freezing Attack:** Has a 50% chance to create freezing effect at enemy's position when attacking
  * **Liquid Terrain Speed:** Moves 2x faster in liquid terrain, 0.5x speed on land
  * **Water Healing:** Heals expForKill HP when standing on water tiles
  * **Frost Healing:** Takes no Frost damage and heals expForKill HP when affected by Frost
  * **Burning Vulnerability:** Takes 1 to ht()/3 damage when affected by Burning
  * **Immunities:** Immune to Frost, Psionic Blast, and Bleeding

==== Behavior ====
  * Adjusts stats based on current dungeon depth (IDepthAdjustable implementation)
  * Changes appearance based on dungeon depth (MultiKindMob implementation)
  * Drops Potion of Frost (10% chance)
  * Moves towards the player when detected
  * More dangerous in water environments

==== Strategy ====
  * Fight away from water to prevent healing
  * Burning effects are especially effective against Water Elementals
  * Be careful of the freezing effect which can create dangerous situations
  * They are significantly faster in water, harder to escape
  * The elemental's damage is fixed at half its HP, making it quite variable depending on level
