====== Potion ======

**Potions** are consumable items in Remixed Dungeon that provide various beneficial or harmful effects when drunk. They are one of the core item types in the game and offer immediate effects that are often crucial for survival.

==== Overview ====
Potions are single-use items that trigger their effect immediately when consumed. They can also be thrown at enemies or allies, or shattered on the ground to trigger their effect in a small area. Potions can be identified by throwing or drinking them, or by using a Scroll of Identify.

==== Common Potions ====
  * [[rpd:potion_of_healing|Potion of Healing]] - Restores health and cures status effects
  * [[rpd:potion_of_experience|Potion of Experience]] - Provides experience points
  * [[rpd:potion_of_frost|Potion of Frost]] - Freezes and damages enemies in an area
  * [[rpd:potion_of_levitation|Potion of Levitation]] - Provides temporary floating ability
  * [[rpd:potion_of_liquid_flame|Potion of Liquid Flame]] - Creates fire in an area
  * [[rpd:potion_of_mind_vision|Potion of Mind Vision]] - Reveals nearby secrets and items
  * [[rpd:potion_of_paralytic_gas|Potion of Paralytic Gas]] - Paralyzes all creatures in an area
  * [[rpd:potion_of_purity|Potion of Purity]] - Neutralizes harmful gases and poisons
  * [[rpd:potion_of_strength|Potion of Strength]] - Permanently increases strength
  * [[rpd:potion_of_toxic_gas|Potion of Toxic Gas]] - Creates toxic gas in an area

==== Throwing Potions ====
Potions can be thrown at enemies to apply their effect to them. When thrown at enemies, beneficial potions (like healing) will harm them, while harmful potions (like paralytic gas) will affect them as intended. Neutral potions (like levitation) have mixed effects.

==== Shattering Potions ====
Potions can be shattered on the ground to activate their effect in a small area around the tile where they break. This can be useful for healing allies, affecting multiple enemies, or using the potion effect when you don't want to drink it yourself.

==== Identification ====
Most potions have similar appearances when unidentified and must be identified before their effect is known. Once identified, the player will know the effect of all future potions of the same type. Potions can be identified through use or with a Scroll of Identify.

==== Obtaining ====
  * Found randomly throughout dungeon levels
  * Available in shops
  * Dropped by various enemies
  * Found in containers and special rooms
  * Created through alchemy (in some game versions)
