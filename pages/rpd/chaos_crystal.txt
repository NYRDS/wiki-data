{{ rpd:images:chaoscrystal_sprite.png|Chaos Crystal }}

The Chaos Crystal is a powerful magical component used to create chaotic items by fusing with existing equipment in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Stats ====
  * **Rarity**: Special
  * **Weight**: 1
  * **Charges**: Starts at 0, increases with damage taken up to max of 100
  * **Identified**: Gradually identified (2 levels needed for full identification)

==== Description ====
The Chaos Crystal is a volatile magical component that transforms regular items into chaotic variants. When damaged while equipped, it gains charges. When fully identified, it gains a **Fuse** action to transform other items.

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Charge Gain:** Gains 1 charge each time the hero takes damage (capped at 100)
  * **Identification:** Becomes fully identified after taking damage twice (identifyLevel 2)
  * **Chaos Mark:** When cursed, casting the crystal places a chaos mark at the target location using all charges
  * **Fusing:** Once fully identified with 50+ charges, can fuse with items via the **Fuse** action

==== Fusing Results ====
When fusing with the **Fuse** action using 50+ charges:
  * **Melee Weapon →** [[rpd:chaos_sword|Chaos Sword]]
  * **Bow →** [[rpd:chaos_bow|Chaos Bow]]
  * **Armor →** [[rpd:chaos_armor|Chaos Armor]]
  * **Wand →** [[rpd:chaos_staff|Chaos Staff]]
  * **Shield →** [[rpd:chaos_shield|Chaos Shield]]
  * **Scroll →** [[rpd:scroll_of_weapon_upgrade|Scroll of Weapon Upgrade]]

==== Acquisition ====
  * Dropped by the [[rpd:heart_of_darkness|Heart of Darkness]] boss in the [[rpd:spider_level|Spider Level]]

==== Strategy ====
  * Build charges by taking damage strategically (e.g. from friendly Gnoll mobs)
  * Wait until you have 50+ charges and full identification before fusing
  * Consider which equipment piece would benefit most from chaotic transformation
  * Use the Chaos Mark ability when cursed to deal area damage
