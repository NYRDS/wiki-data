====== Weapon Upgrades ======

Weapon upgrades are enhancement levels that increase the base stats of weapons in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Upgrade Mechanics ====
Weapons can be upgraded to improve their performance:

  * **Positive Upgrades** - Ranging from +1 to +15, increasing damage and attack speed
  * **Negative Upgrades** - Ranging from -1 to -2, decreasing damage and performance
  * **Curses** - Negative effects that can be applied to weapons

==== Positive Upgrades ====
Each positive upgrade level provides:
  * Increased damage range
  * Improved attack speed in some cases
  * Better overall performance
  * Higher chance of success when fighting enemies

==== Negative Upgrades ====
Negative upgrades result in:
  * Reduced damage output
  * Potentially slower attack speed
  * More likely to break during use
  * Possible curse effects

==== Acquisition ====
  * **Scroll of Upgrade** - Applies a single upgrade level
  * **Scroll of Weapon Upgrade** - Applies multiple upgrade levels specifically to weapons
  * **Shop purchases** - Occasionally found in higher-level shops
  * **Alchemy crafting** - Can be created through alchemical processes
  * **Treasure drops** - Higher-level weapons may spawn upgraded

==== Strategy ====
  * Balance upgrade level with your strength requirements
  * Consider the upgrade limits of your current equipment
  * Take into account the risk of equipment breaking during upgrades
  * Prioritize upgrading your main weapon for maximum impact
  * For weapons with high upgrade levels, ensure you can meet strength requirements

==== Preservation ====
  * **Scroll of Remove Curse** - Can remove negative upgrades from cursed items
  * **Cleansing mechanics** - Some abilities can clear negative effects
  * **Repair options** - Some NPCs or items may provide repair services
