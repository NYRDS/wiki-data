====== Prison ======

The Prison is a dungeon area located beneath the sewers, originally built many years ago for the most dangerous criminals. It's a challenging area with both mechanical and magical dangers.

==== Description ====
Many years ago an underground prison was built here for the most dangerous criminals. At the time it seemed like a very clever idea, because this place indeed was very hard to escape. But soon dark miasma started to permeate from below, driving prisoners and guards insane. In the end the prison was abandoned, though some convicts were left locked up here.
