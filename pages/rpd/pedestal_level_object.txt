====== Pedestal Level Object ======

{{ rpd:images:pedestal_level_object.png|Pedestal }}

**Pedestals** are special level objects found in the Necropolis level. They serve as platforms for the Lich to summon Runic Skulls during the boss fight.

==== Description ====
Pedestals are stationary level objects that appear throughout the Necropolis level. During the Lich boss battle, the Lich will summon Runic Skulls onto these pedestals which then provide various effects to assist the Lich in combat.

==== Appearance ====
  * Found primarily in the Necropolis level
  * Serve as anchor points for Runic Skulls during the Lich fight
  * Cannot be moved or destroyed by the player

==== Mechanics ====
  * During the Lich battle, 2-4 pedestals will have Runic Skulls spawned on them (depending on difficulty)
  * The Lich activates these skulls every 5 turns
  * Each skull type provides different effects to aid the Lich
  * When the Lich is defeated, all runic skulls are cleared from pedestals

==== Strategy ====
  * Focus on pedestals with active skulls during the Lich battle
  * Position yourself to attack multiple skulls if they cluster together
  * Be prepared for skull effects when they activate
