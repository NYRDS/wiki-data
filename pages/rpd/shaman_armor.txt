====== Shaman Armor ======

{{ rpd:images:shamanarmor_sprite.png|Shaman Armor Sprite }}

**Shaman Armor** is the class-specific armor obtained by using an [[rpd:armor_kit|Armor Kit]] on any regular armor for the [[rpd:shaman|Shaman]] subclass in Remixed Dungeon. It is a variant of [[rpd:elf_armor|Elf Armor]] with the same visual appearance and special properties.

==== Acquisition ====
  * Use an [[rpd:armor_kit|Armor Kit]] on any regular armor while playing as an [[rpd:elf|Elf]] who has chosen the [[rpd:shaman|Shaman]] subclass
  * Transforms the base armor into Shaman Armor with special properties
  * [[rpd:armor_kit|Armor Kit]] is typically obtained by defeating the [[rpd:king|King]] boss on level 15 of the [[rpd:city|City]]

==== Special Properties ====
  * Inherits all properties of [[rpd:elf_armor|Elf Armor]]
  * Has a helmet that covers the hair
  * Exclusive to the [[rpd:shaman|Shaman]] subclass - cannot be equipped if not the [[rpd:shaman|Shaman]] subclass
  * When equipped by non-Shaman subclass, displays message: "This armor can only be worn by a shaman."

==== Usage ====
  * Essential armor for maximizing the effectiveness of the [[rpd:shaman|Shaman]] subclass
  * Should be crafted as soon as possible after choosing the [[rpd:shaman|Shaman]] subclass
  * Allows full utilization of subclass abilities

==== Technical Details ====
  * **Java Class:** [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/watabou/pixeldungeon/items/armor/ShamanArmor.java|com.watabou.pixeldungeon.items.armor.ShamanArmor]]
  * **Inheritance:** Extends [[rpd:elf_armor|ElfArmor]] class
  * **Implementation:** Uses the same image as [[rpd:elf_armor|Elf Armor]] (image index 19)

==== Notes ====
  * Part of the subclass identity system in Remixed Dungeon
  * Class armors represent the unique nature of each subclass
  * Cannot be worn by characters who haven't unlocked the appropriate subclass
  * Inherits the base [[rpd:elf_armor|Elf armor]] properties
