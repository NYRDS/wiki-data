**Paralytic Gas** is a harmful gas effect in Remixed Dungeon that causes paralysis to creatures that breathe it.

==== Description ====
When characters are exposed to paralytic gas, they become paralyzed and unable to act for a period of time. The gas is typically created by throwing a [[rpd:potion_of_paralytic_gas_item|Potion of Paralytic Gas]].

==== Effects ====
  * **Paralysis**: Characters caught in the gas cloud are unable to take actions
  * **Duration**: Affected characters remain paralyzed for several turns
  * **Spread**: The gas spreads in a cloud around the point of origin

  * [[rpd:paralysis_arrow_item|Paralysis Arrows]] - Created by moistening arrows with the potion
  * [[rpd:level_objects|Level Objects]] - Some level objects can produce paralytic gas
