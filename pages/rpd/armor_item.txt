==== Description ====
Armor is equipment worn to reduce incoming damage from enemy attacks. Different types of armor offer various levels of protection and special abilities.

==== Stats ====
  * **Defense Rating (DR)**: Reduces physical damage taken
  * **Armor Penetration**: Some attacks ignore a percentage of armor
  * **Strength Requirement**: Minimum strength needed to wear without penalties
  * **Speed Penalty**: Heavier armors may slow movement
  * **Durability**: Armor degrades with use (in some game modes)
