====== Armor Item ======

{{ rpd:images:armor_item.png|Armor Item }}

**Armor** is a type of equipment in Remixed Dungeon that provides damage reduction to the wearer. This page specifically covers armor as an item type, while [[rpd:armor|Armor mechanics]] covers the general system. Armor is essential for surviving in the dungeon and comes in various tiers and types.

==== Item Properties ====
Armor items provide damage reduction (DR) to the wearer, reducing the amount of damage taken from physical attacks. Each armor piece has a specific DR value and requires a certain strength level to use effectively. Wearing armor that is too heavy for your strength will result in movement penalties.

  * **Damage Reduction (DR):** Reduces incoming physical damage
  * **Strength Requirement:** Minimum strength needed to wear without penalties
  * **Durability:** Armor degrades over time with use
  * **Armor Class:** Different armor classes provide different special abilities

==== Item Identification ====
  * Unidentified armor appears as "armor" with unknown stats
  * [[rpd:scroll_of_identify_item|Scrolls of Identify]] can reveal armor properties
  * Identified armor shows its specific type and stats

==== Item Acquisition ====
  * Found throughout dungeon levels
  * Available in shops
  * Dropped by enemies
  * Crafted using alchemy
  * Starting equipment for hero classes

==== Item Management ====

  * **Gems:** Some armor can be enchanted with gems for additional properties
  * **Glyps:** Armor can be imbued with special glyps for unique effects
  * **Strength Penalties:** Wearing armor above your strength threshold reduces movement speed

==== Item Categories ====
  * **Tier Armor:** [[rpd:cloth_armor_item|Cloth]], Leather, Mail, Scale, Plate armor
