====== Armored Statue ======

The **Armored Statue** is a special enemy found in Remixed Pixel Dungeon.

==== Description ====
Armored Statues are animated stone or metal statues that serve as guardians in certain parts of the dungeon. They're well-armored and present a significant defensive challenge.

==== Stats ====
* HP: High
* Defense: Very High (Heavy armor)
* Attack: Moderate to High
* Speed: Slow
* Special: High physical damage resistance

==== Tactics ====
Armored Statues are most effectively defeated with high-damage weapons or magical attacks that can bypass their physical armor. Piercing or elemental attacks work better than simple physical attacks. They tend to be slow, giving players time to position strategically.
