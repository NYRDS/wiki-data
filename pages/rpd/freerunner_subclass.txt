====== Free Runner Subclass ======

{{ rpd:images:hero_ROGUE_FREERUNNER.png|Free Runner }}

The **Free Runner** is a hero subclass for the [[rpd:rogue_class|Rogue]] class in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Description ====
The _Freerunner_ can move almost twice faster, than most of the monsters. When he is running, the Freerunner is much harder to hit. For that he must be unencumbered and not starving.

==== Unlocking ====
The Free Runner subclass can be unlocked by using a [[rpd:tome_of_mastery_item|Tome of Mastery]] after defeating the second boss (Tengu). This item can also be used with a [[rpd:tengu_liver_item|Tengu Liver]] if using a class that normally can't use Tomes of Mastery.

==== Special Mechanics ====
The Free Runner has the following special mechanics implemented in the game code:
  * **Speed Advantage:** Gets 1.6x movement speed when not starving (as implemented in Hero.java)
  * **Evasion Bonus:** Gets 2x evasion when not starving and in motion (defensive skill is doubled during movement)
  * **Requirements:** Must not be starving to maintain the special mechanics
  * **Movement Bonuses:** Speed and evasion bonuses apply when character is moving and not starving

==== Special Armor ====
Using an [[rpd:armor_kit_item|Armor Kit]] on any armor will transform it into [[rpd:freerunner_armor|Free Runner Armor]], which is specifically designed for this subclass.

==== Advantages ====
  * Significantly faster movement speed when conditions are met
  * Harder to hit when running
  * Excellent for escape and positioning
  * Good for hit-and-run tactics

==== Disadvantages ====
  * Requires being unencumbered (not overburdened)
  * Must not be starving
  * Speed advantage is lost when heavily loaded
  * Requires careful food management
