For languages with grammatical gender (as in German or Russian for example) it can be defined (using **masculine**, **feminine** and **neuter** tags in Mob_Gender string) for each mob. Corresponding phrases also can be defined in gender specific way.

Gender tags should not be translated, but changed to correct for target languge.

  'Subjeсt' do something on 'Object'

And can take in account grammatical gender of 'Subjeсt', provided it correctly tagged in 'XXX_Gender' (one of 'masculine', 'feminine' or 'neuter')
