{{ rpd:images:clotharmor_sprite.png|Cloth Armor }}

**Cloth Armor** is a basic armor item in Remixed Dungeon. It's the lightest and most basic form of armor protection, often found early in the dungeon or as starting equipment for some classes.

==== Item Overview ====
  * **Type:** Armor
  * **Tier:** 1 (lowest tier armor)
  * **Base Defense:** Lowest defense rating among all armor types
  * **Durability:** Standard for armor
  * **Strength Required:** Minimal (based on tier)
  * **Special Properties:** Can be inscribed with glyphs via [[rpd:arcane_stylus_item|Arcane Stylus]]

==== Description ====
This lightweight armor offers basic protection against enemy attacks. While it provides minimal defense compared to higher-tier armors, it has the advantage of requiring very little strength to wear effectively.

==== Special Mechanics ====
  * **Glyph Inscription:** Can have a random [[rpd:glyph|glyph]] applied using an [[rpd:arcane_stylus_item|Arcane Stylus]]
  * **Upgrading:** Can be upgraded using [[rpd:scroll_of_upgrade_item|Scrolls of Upgrade]] to improve defense rating
  * **Minimal Strength Requirement:** Due to tier 1 status, requires minimal strength to wear without movement penalties

==== Strategy ====
  * Essential early-game protection when no other armor is available
  * Good temporary solution until better armor is found
  * Consider upgrading if found with good initial stats
  * Can be useful with the right glyph inscription
  * Light weight makes it good for carrying without encumbrance concerns

==== Acquisition ====
  * Sometimes found as starting equipment for certain classes
  * Available in early-game shops
  * Dropped by some early enemies
  * Found randomly throughout the dungeon
