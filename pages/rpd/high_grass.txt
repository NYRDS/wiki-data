{{ rpd:images:high_grass_terrain.png|High Grass }}

**High Grass** is a terrain feature found throughout the dungeon that provides special properties and interactions. It has the following characteristics:

==== Properties ====
  * **Movement**: Passable terrain that characters can move through normally
  * **Line of Sight**: Blocks line of sight (LOS_BLOCKING flag)
  * **Flammable**: Can be burned by fire-based effects
  * **Trampling**: When trampled, converts to regular grass terrain
  * **Visibility**: Does not typically block line of sight for the player

==== Contents ====
  * **Drops**: Trampling may yield dewdrops (chance increases with Herbalism ring level)
  * **Seeds**: Trampling may yield random seeds (chance increases with Herbalism ring level)
  * **Hidden Items**: Some items may be hidden until the grass is trampled
  * **Traps**: Some traps may be concealed in high grass until triggered

==== Interaction ====
  * Moving over high grass tramples it, converting it to regular grass
  * Trampling generates leaf particles (4 particles normally, 2 for Scout, 8 for Warden)
  * Some hero subclasses have special interactions when trampling high grass:
    * **Scout**: Gains 5 turns of invisibility when trampling high grass
    * **Warden**: Gains barkskin (HP/3) for a short duration when trampling high grass
  * Ring of Herbalism increases chances of dewdrop and seed drops when trampling

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Terrain ID**: 15 (Terrain.HIGH_GRASS constant)
  * **Flags**: PASSABLE | LOS_BLOCKING | FLAMMABLE
  * **Trample Effect**: Converts to regular grass (Terrain.GRASS)
  * **Drops**: Random dewdrops and seeds based on Herbalism buff level

==== Strategy ====
  * Use high grass strategically for concealment during combat
  * Consider subclass abilities when planning movement through high grass areas
  * Trample carefully if you want to preserve the concealment benefit
  * Be aware that some enemies may be hidden in high grass until you step on it
