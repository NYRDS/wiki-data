====== Spider Charm ======

The **Spider Charm** is an artifact in Remixed Pixel Dungeon that allows the hero to summon friendly spider servants. It drops from the [[rpd:spider_queen|Spider Queen]] boss.

==== Function ====
When used, the Spider Charm creates a friendly Spider Servant ally at the cost of 1/4 of the hero's max HP. The summoned spider serves as a temporary ally in combat.

==== Stats ====
  * **Action**: Use
  * **Health Cost**: 1/4 of hero's max HP
  * **Summoned**: Spider Servant mob
  * **Location**: Dropped by Spider Queen boss in Spider Nest level

==== Strategy ====
The Spider Charm provides tactical advantages by creating an additional combatant to assist in battles. However, the health cost requires careful timing of its use. Consider the following:

  * The health cost is significant (25% of max HP), so use carefully
  * Best used when the hero has high HP or healing available
  * The summoned Spider Servant can tank damage and distract enemies
  * Particularly useful in groups of enemies or against powerful single targets
