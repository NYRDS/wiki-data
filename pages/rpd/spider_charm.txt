==== Description ====
This exotic trinket is shrouded by aura of mystery. Who knows, what might happen to one who wears it?

Spider Charm is an artifact that can summon a spider servant to fight alongside the player. However, using it requires self-harm, similar to other summoning items in the game.

==== Stats ====
  * **Rarity:** Artifact
  * **Weight:** 1
  * **Action:** USE
  * **Identified:** Yes (always identified)

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Self-Damage:** Using the charm causes damage equal to 1/4 of max HP (25%)
  * **Spider Summoning:** Summons a [[rpd:spider_servant|Spider Servant]] to fight alongside the player
  * **Positioning:** The spider spawns in an adjacent empty cell to the user
  * **Pet Status:** The summoned spider acts as a pet allied with the player

==== Acquisition ====
  * Dropped by the [[rpd:spider_queen|Spider Queen]] boss (33% chance)
  * Can be found occasionally in [[rpd:spider_level|Spider Level]] treasure rooms

==== Strategy ====
  * Use when you have sufficient HP to spare the self-damage
  * The spider servant provides additional combat support and can tank damage
  * Since it's summoned by the Spider Queen, it fits well with the spider-themed area
  * Consider having healing items or effects ready after use
  * Useful for crowd control in heavily populated areas

==== Mechanics Notes ====
  * The charm removes any existing Health buff (from Sungrass) when used
  * The summoned spider is spawned using the Mob.makePet system
  * Uses the getEmptyCellNextTo method to find a suitable location for the summoned spider
