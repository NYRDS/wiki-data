====== Blank Scroll ======

==== Description ====
A blank scroll that appears to be unused. It can be inscribed with magical properties using an [[rpd:arcane_stylus|Arcane Stylus]].

==== Special Properties ====
  * Can be inscribed using an [[rpd:arcane_stylus|Arcane Stylus]]
  * When inscribed, becomes a random scroll from the available scroll types
  * Provides a way to create useful scrolls when no other scrolls are available

==== Usage ====
To use a Blank Scroll, you need an Arcane Stylus to inscribe it. The resulting scroll will be randomly selected from the possible scroll types available in the current game state.

==== Notes ====
Blank Scrolls are valuable items that can be transformed into useful scrolls using an Arcane Stylus. They provide a way to replenish scroll supplies when the dungeon's usual scroll generation is insufficient.
