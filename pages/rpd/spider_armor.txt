====== Spider Armor ======

{{ rpd:images:spiderarmor_sprite.png|Spider Armor Sprite }}

==== Description ====
This armor is made of old spider chitin and some kind of clothing. Most surprisingly, it seems that it still contains functioning spider glands. If you press the plates hard enough, then they shoot out web. And jagged soles allow you to move freely on such type of web.

Spider Armor is a unique armor that has a 50% chance to create webs when taking damage, potentially hindering attackers.
