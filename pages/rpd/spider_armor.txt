The spider armor is made from somehow still-alive spider hitin covers.

Lucky adventurers who own one can walk through any spider web without risking to get trapped in. Another great thing about Spider Armor is the ability to throw spider web on enemies.

From perspective of weight and protection, Spider Armor is on par with Mail Armor.
