  * **Storage:** Gold is lost upon death (same as other inventory items)
  * **Value:** All gold pieces have the same value
  * **Collection:** Automatically added to inventory when picked up
  * **Quantity Images:** Different coin stack sizes have different visual representations (0-9, 10-99, 100-999, 1000+)
  * **Drop Amount:** Enemies typically drop (20 + depth * 10) to (40 + depth * 20) gold coins
