====== Equipment Slots ======

Equipment slots define where the hero can equip different items in Remixed Dungeon. Each slot can hold a specific type of equipment, contributing to the hero's capabilities.

==== Slot Types ====
  * **Weapon** - Main hand weapon slot for melee or ranged weapons
  * **Shield** - Off hand slot for shields or secondary weapons
  * **Armor** - Body slot for armor pieces
  * **Ring 1** - First finger slot for rings
  * **Ring 2** - Second finger slot for rings
  * **Amulet** - Neck slot for amulets (currently only the Amulet of Yendor)
  * **Artifact** - Special slot for artifacts

==== Special Considerations ====
  * Rings: The hero has two ring slots that can be filled with any ring. Each ring provides its own unique effect.
  * Armor: Only one armor piece can be worn at a time, but it can be upgraded to improve its effectiveness.
  * Weapons/Shields: Depending on the weapon, you may be able to equip a shield in the off-hand, or wield a two-handed weapon.
  * Artifacts: Special items that occupy a unique artifact slot.
