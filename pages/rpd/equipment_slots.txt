====== Equipment Slots and Dual Wielding ======

Remixed Pixel Dungeon features an expanded equipment system that allows for more strategic customization, including dual wielding and shields.

==== Equipment Slots ====

The hero has multiple equipment slots for different items:

  * **Weapon Slot**: Main hand for weapons like swords, bows, and other offensive items
  * **Left Hand Slot**: Off-hand slot for shields, secondary weapons, or other items
  * **Armor Slot**: Body armor that provides protection
  * **Artifact Slot**: Unique magical artifacts
  * **Left Artifact Slot**: Off-hand artifact slot for additional magical items

==== Dual Wielding ====

With the introduction of the **Left Hand Slot**, players can now dual wield weapons or use a combination of weapons and shields. 

The dual wielding system allows:
  * Equipping two weapons for increased offensive capabilities
  * Using a weapon and a shield for balanced offense and defense
  * Customizing combat style based on strategy and enemy types

==== Shields ====

Shields are special defensive items that can be equipped in the Left Hand slot. They provide various defensive benefits:

  * **Chaos Shield**: A shield created by fusing a Chaos Crystal with an ordinary shield, causing it to manifest random chaotic effects upon a successful block
  * Other moddable shields that provide different defensive properties

==== Handedness Option ====

Remixed Dungeon includes a UI handedness option that allows players to switch the layout of the interface between:
  * **Right-handed**: Default UI layout
  * **Left-handed**: Reversed UI layout for left-handed players

This option can be changed in the game settings and affects the positioning of control buttons.

==== Strategic Considerations ====

  * Dual wielding increases attack frequency but may sacrifice defensive capabilities
  * Using a shield reduces offensive output but significantly increases defensive stats
  * Some weapons can only be used in the main hand due to size/strength requirements
  * The choice of off-hand equipment significantly affects combat strategy
