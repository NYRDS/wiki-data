====== Hero Subclasses ======

Hero Subclasses are advanced specialization paths available to heroes in Remixed Dungeon. Each hero class can choose a subclass after defeating the second boss (Tengu).

==== Unlocking Subclasses ====
  * Subclasses are unlocked using a [[rpd:tome_of_mastery_item|Tome of Mastery]]
  * The Tome can be found after defeating Tengu (the 2nd boss)
  * Each hero class has two subclass options to choose from
  * **Special Cases:** The Necromancer and Gnoll classes cannot normally use the Tome of Mastery. Instead, the Gnoll class can use a [[rpd:tengu_liver_item|Tengu Liver]] (dropped by Tengu) to choose between Guardian or Witch Doctor subclasses.

==== Available Subclasses ====
  * **Warrior:** [[rpd:gladiator_subclass|Gladiator]] or [[rpd:berserker_subclass|Berserker]]
  * **Mage:** [[rpd:warlock_subclass|Warlock]] or [[rpd:battle_mage|Battle Mage]]
  * **Rogue:** [[rpd:assassin_subclass|Assassin]] or [[rpd:freerunner|Free Runner]]
  * **Huntress:** [[rpd:sniper_subclass|Sniper]] or [[rpd:warden_subclass|Warden]]
  * **Elf:** [[rpd:scout_subclass|Scout]] or [[rpd:shaman_subclass|Shaman]]
  * **Necromancer:** [[rpd:lich_subclass|Lich]] (Note: Necromancer class does not receive Tome of Mastery, special mechanics apply)
  * **Gnoll:** [[rpd:guardian|Guardian]] or [[rpd:witchdoctor|Witch Doctor]]

==== Subclass Mechanics ====
  * Each subclass provides unique combat advantages
  * [[rpd:class_armor|Class Armor]] - Special armor obtained by using [[rpd:armor_kit_item|Armor Kit]] on regular armor
  * Special abilities that trigger during combat
  * Different playstyle emphasis (e.g., offensive vs defensive)

==== Strategy ====
  * Consider your playstyle when choosing a subclass
  * Subclass abilities synergize with specific equipment
  * Some subclasses work better with certain main classes
  * Class armor provides powerful subclass-specific effects
