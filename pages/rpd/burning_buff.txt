**Burning** is a harmful status effect in Remixed Dungeon that causes continuous damage to the affected character.

==== Description ====
The Burning status effect causes continuous damage over time. Characters affected by burning will take damage each turn until the effect ends. The effect can be spread to flammable terrain and can cause carried items to burn.

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Damage:** Takes 1-5 + (Dungeon.depth / 2) damage each turn
  * **Duration:** Varies based on character's resistance and health
  * **Spreads:** To flammable terrain when the affected character moves
  * **Item effect:** Carried items may be damaged by the fire
  * **Ends when:** Character dies, duration expires, or character steps in water (if not flying)

==== Causes ====
Burning can be caused by:
  * [[rpd:fire_elemental_mob|Fire Elementals]] and other fire-based enemies
  * [[rpd:wand_of_firebolt_item|Wand of Firebolt]]
  * [[rpd:ignite_spell|Ignite Spell]]
  * [[rpd:fire_enchantment|Fire Enchantments]] on weapons
  * [[rpd:burning_fist_mob|Burning Fist]] boss
  * [[rpd:torch_item|Torch]] usage in confined spaces
  * [[rpd:fire_trap|Fire Traps]]

==== Resistance ====
  * [[rpd:ring_of_elements_item|Ring of Elements]] can provide partial resistance
  * Some classes and subclasses have natural resistance to burning

==== Counters ====
  * Step in water (if not flying) to extinguish the flames
  * Certain healing effects may remove the status
  * Resistances provided by specific [[rpd:rings|Rings]]

==== Strategic Implications ====
  * Burning can be used strategically to clear grassy areas
  * Be careful when fighting in flammable environments as fire may spread
  * Burning enemies can spread fire to other nearby enemies
  * The effect is particularly dangerous in the early game when health pools are small
