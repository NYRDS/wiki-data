The Scout is the Elf's subclass in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Unlocking ====
The Scout subclass can be unlocked by using a Tome of Mastery after defeating the second boss (Tengu).

Elven _Scouts_ are masters of stealth. Trampling high grass grants them a temporary invisibility buff. Also they are even faster than regular Elves.

==== Advantages ====
  * Temporary invisibility from trampling high grass
  * Faster than regular Elves
  * Additional stealth capabilities
  * Enhanced escape options
  * Good for exploration and evasion

==== Disadvantages ====
  * Invisibility buff is temporary
  * Requires presence of high grass to benefit
  * Speed advantage may not be significant in all situations
