{{ rpd:images:hero_ELF_SCOUT.png|Scout }}

Elven _Scouts_ are masters of stealth. Trampling high grass grants them a temporary invisibility buff for 5 turns. Also they are even faster than regular Elves due to their haste level bonus.

==== Unlocking ====
The Scout subclass can be unlocked by using a [[rpd:tome_of_mastery|Tome of Mastery]] after defeating the second boss (Tengu).

==== Description ====
Scout is a subclass of the [[rpd:elf|Elf]] class in Remixed Dungeon. Elven Scouts are masters of stealth who excel in exploration and evasion tactics.

==== Special Mechanics ====
When a Scout moves through or tramples high grass, they receive a temporary invisibility buff lasting 5 turns. Scouts also have an inherent speed advantage over other subclasses due to their haste level bonus.

==== Special Abilities ====
  * **Invisibility on Trampling:** Trampling high grass grants temporary invisibility for 5 turns
  * **Increased Speed:** Has a natural haste level bonus, making them faster than regular Elves
  * **Stealth Mastery:** Enhanced ability to avoid detection and navigate undetected

==== Special Armor ====
Using an [[rpd:armor_kit|Armor Kit]] on any armor will transform it into the [[rpd:scout_armor|Scout Armor]], which is specifically designed for this subclass.

==== Advantages ====
  * Tactical invisibility for escaping dangerous situations
  * Superior exploration capabilities
  * Increased movement speed for better positioning
  * Effective for hit-and-run tactics

==== Disadvantages ====
  * Invisibility buff is temporary (5 turns)
  * Requires presence of high grass to benefit from invisibility
  * Speed advantage is less significant in tight spaces

==== Strategy ====
  * Use high grass strategically to gain invisibility before engaging enemies
  * Take advantage of the extra speed for positioning and escaping dangerous situations
  * Combine invisibility with other stealth-enhancing items or abilities
  * Make use of the extra speed to reach objectives more quickly
  * Utilize hit-and-run tactics, using invisibility to disengage when needed
