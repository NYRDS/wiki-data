====== Wand of Slowness ======

{{ rpd:images:wand_of_slowness_item.png|Wand of Slowness }}

The Wand of Slowness is a magical wand in Remixed Dungeon that reduces the speed of enemies. When zapped at a target, it applies the Slow status effect, making the affected creature move and attack at half its ordinary speed.

==== Effect ====
When used on a target, the Wand of Slowness applies the [[rpd:slow_buff|Slow]] status effect:
  * **Speed Reduction:** Affected creatures move and attack at half their ordinary speed
  * **Duration:** The effect lasts for (10 / 3 + effectiveLevel()) turns, where 10 is the base duration of Slow buff
  * **Area of Effect:** Single target only
  * **Range:** Standard wand range
  * **Visual Effect:** Causes a distinctive slowing animation effect

==== Properties ====
  * **Type:** Wand
  * **Special Effect:** Applies Slow status effect to target
  * **Targeting:** Single-target direct aiming
  * **Charges:** Recharges over time like other wands
  * **Image:** ''items.png'' index (determined by SimpleWand base class)

==== Mechanics ====
  * When zapped at a target, applies slow effect for (Slow.duration(char) / 3 + effectiveLevel()) turns
  * The base duration of the Slow buff is 10f, which is modified by Resistance effects
  * As wand level increases, the duration of the slow effect increases (by 1 turn per level)
  * The slow effect reduces action speed by approximately 7.27254 haste level (negative value)
  * The effect duration formula: 10 / 3 + wand effective level (after Resistance modifications)
  * If the wand is zapped at an empty cell, shows "nothing happened" message

==== Strategy ====
  * Use to slow down powerful enemies to gain an advantage in combat
  * Particularly effective against fast-moving enemies that would otherwise be difficult to hit
  * Good for slowing down groups of enemies one by one
  * Can be used defensively to slow approaching enemies
  * Works well in combination with other status effects
  * Very effective against time-sensitive monsters like Tengu
  * Useful during boss fights to create breathing room
  * Synergizes well with other control effects like paralysis or vertigo
