{{ rpd:images:wand_of_slowness_item.png|Wand of Slowness }}

The Wand of Slowness is a magical wand in Remixed Dungeon that reduces the speed of enemies.

==== Effect ====
When used on a target, the Wand of Slowness applies the [[rpd:slow_buff|Slow]] status effect:
  * **Speed Reduction:** Targets have their action speed significantly reduced
  * **Duration:** The effect lasts for a specific duration depending on the target and wand level
  * **Area of Effect:** Single target only
  * **Range:** Standard wand range

==== Properties ====
  * **Type:** Wand
  * **Special Effect:** Applies Slow status effect to target
  * **Targeting:** Single-target direct aiming
  * **Charges:** Recharges over time like other wands

==== Mechanics ====
  * When zapped at a target, applies slow effect for (base duration / 3 + effectiveLevel()) turns
  * As wand level increases, the duration of the slow effect increases
  * The slow effect reduces action speed, making affected creatures act more slowly
  * Primary tactical use is to slow down dangerous or fast enemies

==== Strategy ====
  * Use to slow down powerful enemies to gain an advantage in combat
  * Particularly effective against fast-moving enemies that would otherwise be difficult to hit
  * Good for slowing down groups of enemies one by one
  * Can be used defensively to slow approaching enemies
  * Works well in combination with other status effects
