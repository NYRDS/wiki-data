====== Resistances ======

Resistances in Remixed Dungeon refer to reduced effectiveness of certain status effects, damage types, or other harmful effects that characters or mobs can possess. Unlike immunities, resistances reduce but don't completely prevent the effect.

==== Types of Resistances ====

==== Elemental Resistances ====
  * **Fire Resistance**: Reduces damage from fire-based attacks and effects
  * **Cold Resistance**: Reduces damage from cold/frost-based attacks and effects
  * **Electric Resistance**: Reduces damage from electric/lightning-based attacks
  * **Acid Resistance**: Reduces damage from acid-based attacks

==== Status Effect Resistances ====
  * **Poison Resistance**: Reduces damage over time from poison
  * **Bleeding Resistance**: Reduces damage over time from bleeding
  * **Paralysis Resistance**: Reduces duration of paralysis effects
  * **Blindness Resistance**: Reduces duration of blindness effects
  * **Charm Resistance**: Reduces susceptibility to charm effects

==== Physical Resistances ====
  * **Physical Damage Resistance**: Reduces direct physical damage taken
  * **Critical Hit Resistance**: Reduces chance of being critically hit

==== Acquiring Resistances ====
  * **Armor**: Different armor types provide different resistances
  * **Buffs**: Temporary resistances granted by buff effects
  * **Equipment**: Rings, artifacts, or other items that provide resistances
  * **Hero Classes**: Some hero classes have natural resistances
  * **Mobs**: Certain mobs have resistances to specific damage types or effects

==== Equipment Providing Resistances ====
  * **Armor**: Higher level armor typically provides better resistances
  * **Rings**: Some rings provide elemental resistances
  * **Artifacts**: Special items that might offer unique resistances

==== Strategy ====
  * Identify the resistances of enemies to choose effective tactics
  * Stack resistances against common dungeon threats
  * Consider resistances when selecting equipment for specific dungeon areas
  * Different resistances are more valuable in different dungeon sections
