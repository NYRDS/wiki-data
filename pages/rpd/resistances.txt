====== Resistances ======

Resistances in Remixed Dungeon refer to reduced effectiveness of certain status effects, damage types, or other harmful effects that characters or mobs can possess. Unlike immunities, resistances reduce but don't completely prevent the effect.

==== Mechanics ====
When a character has resistance to a specific source of damage or effect, the damage is reduced to a random value between 0 and the original damage amount (Random.IntRange(0, original_dmg)). This means resistances provide an average of 50% damage reduction against the specific effect they resist.

==== Types of Resistances ====

==== Elemental and Damage Type Resistances ====
  * **Fire Resistance**: Reduces damage from fire-based attacks and effects (Burning, LiquidFlame, BurningFist) - provided by [[rpd:ring_of_elements_item|Ring of Elements]]
  * **Poison Resistance**: Reduces damage over time from poison (see [[rpd:poison_buff|Poison]]) - provided by [[rpd:ring_of_elements_item|Ring of Elements]]
  * **Electric Resistance**: Reduces damage from electric/lightning-based attacks (LightningTrap) - provided by [[rpd:ring_of_elements_item|Ring of Elements]]
  * **Toxic Gas Resistance**: Reduces damage from toxic gas clouds - provided by [[rpd:ring_of_elements_item|Ring of Elements]]

==== Status Effect Resistances ====
  * **Various Status Effects**: [[rpd:ring_of_elements_item|Ring of Elements]] also provides resistance to certain mob-specific attacks (Warlock magic missiles, Eye death rays, etc.)

==== Acquiring Resistances ====
  * **[[rpd:ring_of_elements_item|Ring of Elements]]**: The primary source of elemental resistances, providing resistance to various element-based damage types with a probability based on ring level
  * **Buffs**: Temporary resistances granted by buff effects
  * **[[rpd:hero_classes|Hero Classes]]**: Some hero classes have natural resistances
  * **[[rpd:mobs|Mobs]]**: Certain mobs have resistances to specific damage types or effects

==== Implementation ====
  * Resistances are tracked using entity kind names (getEntityKind()) in the character's resistances collection
  * When taking damage, if the source is in the resistances collection, damage is reduced to a random value between 0 and the original damage
  * The [[rpd:ring_of_elements_item|Ring of Elements]] has a probability calculation (Random.Int(level + 3) >= 3) to determine if its resistances are active

==== Strategy ====
  * [[rpd:ring_of_elements_item|Ring of Elements]] resistances become more reliable as the ring level increases
  * Resistances provide an average of 50% damage reduction against specific sources
  * Higher-level Rings of Elements provide more consistent protection
