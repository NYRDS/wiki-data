====== Soul Reaper ======

{{ rpd:images:black_skull_sprite.png|Soul Reaper }}

The **Soul Reaper** is a special version of the [[rpd:black_skull|Black Skull]] artifact that is dropped by the [[rpd:lich|Lich]] boss specifically for players of the [[rpd:necromancer|Necromancer]] class. It serves as both an artifact and a path to [[rpd:lich_mob|mastery]] for Necromancers.

==== Mechanics ====
The Soul Reaper functions similarly to the standard [[rpd:black_skull|Black Skull]] by collecting charges when creatures die nearby and using those charges to resurrect defeated enemies as pets. However, it also serves as a [[rpd:tome_of_mastery|Tome of Mastery]] alternative for the [[rpd:necromancer|Necromancer]] class.

When used, it offers the choice between remaining human and becoming a [[rpd:lich_mob|Lich]] (a Necromancer mastery path).

==== Code Reference ====
The Soul Reaper mechanics are implemented in [[code:com/nyrds/pixeldungeon/items/necropolis/BlackSkullOfMastery.java|BlackSkullOfMastery.java]], which extends the [[code:com/nyrds/pixeldungeon/items/common/MasteryItem.java|MasteryItem.java]] class.
