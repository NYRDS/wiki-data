{{ rpd:images:blackskullofmastery_sprite.png|The Soulbringer }}

The **Soulbringer** (BlackSkullOfMastery) is an ancient artifact dropped by the [[rpd:lich_mob|Lich]] boss specifically for players of the [[rpd:necromancer_class|Necromancer]] class. It serves as both an artifact and a path to [[rpd:lich_subclass|mastery]] for Necromancers.

==== Description ====
It's an ancient artifact, crafted by first necromancers to collect souls of the fallen one's. Sensing your necromantic abilities it warded itself with a powerful spell. But since the spell is that of the old times, it's primitive structure is fairly easy to break.

==== Mechanics ====
When used, the Soulbringer offers the choice between:
  * Breaking the spell (remaining as a Necromancer)
  * Manipulating the spell's magical formula to turn yourself into a [[rpd:lich_subclass|Lich]] (the Necromancer mastery path)

If choosing to become a Lich:
  * The character receives -2 strength penalty
  * The character's skill points are doubled (maxSkillPoints * 2)
  * The character gains necromancy-focused abilities

==== Acquisition ====
  * Dropped only by the [[rpd:lich_mob|Lich]] boss
  * Only drops for players using the [[rpd:necromancer_class|Necromancer]] hero class
  * Other classes receive the standard [[rpd:black_skull_item|Black Skull]] instead

==== Code Reference ====
The Soulbringer mechanics are implemented in [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/nyrds/pixeldungeon/items/necropolis/BlackSkullOfMastery.java|BlackSkullOfMastery.java]], which extends the [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/nyrds/pixeldungeon/items/common/MasteryItem.java|MasteryItem.java]] class.
