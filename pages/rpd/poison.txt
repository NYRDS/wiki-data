====== Poison ======

**Poison** is a status effect that causes damage over time. Characters affected by poison take continuous damage until the effect wears off or is cured.

==== Mechanics ====
  * Causes periodic damage over time
  * Stacks with itself, increasing damage
  * Can be cured with Antidote Potions or certain abilities
  * Does not cause death directly (stops at 1 HP) but can lead to death when combined with other damage

==== Sources ====
  * **Poison Trap**: Common environmental trap
  * **Venom Trap**: More dangerous variant
  * **Sorrowmoss**: Poisonous plant
  * **Various Mobs**: Some enemies can inflict poison
  * **Weapons**: Certain enchantments can cause poison

==== Resistance ====
  * Some armor and rings provide resistance to poison
  * Certain classes have higher natural resistance
  * Resistances stack and can reduce the duration and damage
