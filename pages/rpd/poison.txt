====== Poison ======

Poison is a status effect in Remixed Dungeon that causes ongoing damage to affected creatures over time.

==== Description ====
When a character is poisoned, they take damage at the end of each turn while the poison effect is active. The damage is calculated as (time remaining / 3) + 1, meaning the damage decreases as the poison duration runs out.

==== Effects ====
  * **Damage Over Time:** Causes damage at the end of each turn equal to (time remaining / 3) + 1
  * **Duration:** Lasts for a limited number of turns, varies by source
  * **Stacking:** Multiple poison effects do not stack, but duration can extend if applied while already poisoned
  * **Death:** Causes instant death when the buff ends if the target has not already died from other causes
  * **Badge:** Causes "Death from poison" badge to be earned if player dies from poison

==== Strategy ====
  * **For Players:** Use poison to damage enemies over time without direct engagement
  * **Defensively:** Try to avoid being poisoned during combat as it causes guaranteed damage
  * **Offensively:** Poison is particularly effective against slow-moving enemies that can't reach you quickly
  * **Timing:** Consider poison when planning extended fights, as it ensures damage even if enemy is defensive
