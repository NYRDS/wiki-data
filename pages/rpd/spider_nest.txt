====== Spider Nest (Level) ======

The **Spider Nest** is a special sub-location in Remixed Dungeon that consists of levels 6s through 10s. These specialized levels were added in the remix.19 update and feature unique mechanics distinct from standard dungeon levels.

==== Description ====
Spider Nest levels are specialized dungeon areas characterized by:
  * No doors between rooms - instead, many plants grow everywhere
  * Unique mob spawning mechanics through [[rpd:spider_egg|Spider Eggs]] and [[rpd:spidernest|Spider Nests (Mob)]] rather than random spawning
  * Various spider enemies that appear throughout the levels
  * Spider-specific treasure and mechanics
  * Progressive difficulty and size from level 6s to 10s

==== Spider Nest Levels ====
Spider Nest levels appear as levels 6s through 10s in the dungeon progression:

==== Special Properties ====
  * **Web Creation:** Many spiders can create webs that affect movement
  * **Unique Spawning:** Mobs spawn from [[rpd:spider_egg|eggs]] and [[rpd:spidernest|nests]] instead of random locations
  * **Progressive Difficulty:** Larger maps and stronger enemies at deeper levels
  * **No Doors:** Level layout uses natural connections instead of doors

==== Spider Nest (Mob) ====
The [[rpd:spidernest|Spider Nest (Mob)]] is a special static mob that appears in these levels:
  * **Stationary:** Cannot move and has 0 base speed
  * **Spawning:** Continuously spawns random spider mobs every 20 turns
  * **Fragile:** Has only 10 HP and can be destroyed
  * **Loot:** May drop a Potion of Healing (20% chance)
  * **No Pet:** Cannot be made into a pet

==== Tactics ====
  * Focus on destroying [[rpd:spidernest|Spider Nests]] first to prevent continuous spawning
  * Fire-based attacks are effective against web-filled areas
  * Be prepared for multiple enemies at once
  * Web effects may slow movement
  * Ranged attacks can be advantageous in tight spaces

==== Access ====
  * Can be accessed from level 5 by going down stairs (no special item required)
  * Previously required [[rpd:spider_charm|Spider Charm]] to access

==== Notes ====
Spider Nest levels were designed by Pavel Provotorov and represent unique challenges with their web-spinning abilities and continuous spawning mechanics. These locations can overwhelm unprepared adventurers due to the persistent spawning system.
