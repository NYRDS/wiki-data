====== Codex Content ======

==== Description ====
Codex books in Remixed Dungeon contain randomly selected content from a pool of possible texts. Each codex reveals a different piece of information when read.

==== Types of Content ====
Codex books may contain one of the following types of information:

==== Glyph Descriptions ====
  * **Bounce Glyph** - Causes enemies to be pushed back after hitting the Hero.

  * **Anti-entropy Glyph** - Hero ignites and burns, and enemy freezes.
  * **Multiplication Glyph** - This effect causes the Hero to spawn mirror images but takes damage. This can kill the Hero.
  * **Potential Glyph** - Releases a lightning burst that damages the enemy who attacked the player and damages the Hero for roughly half of the damage dealt to the enemy.
