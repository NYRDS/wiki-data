====== Necrotism ======

**Necrotism** is a unique status effect mechanic in Remixed Pixel Dungeon primarily associated with the [[rpd:necromancer|Necromancer]] class and necromantic enemies.

==== Description ====
Necrotism is a spreading debuff that causes damage to the affected character and can spread to nearby enemies that are not heroes or NPCs. The effect becomes more dangerous with each "iteration" as it spreads from target to target.

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Damage Calculation**: Damage is based on the target's HP; bosses take damage equal to (target.hp/200), others take damage equal to (target.hp / max(3, (21 - iteration)))
  * **Spread**: The effect can spread to adjacent enemies that don't already have necrotism
  * **Iterations**: Each time the effect spreads, it gains an iteration level, making subsequent damage more severe
  * **Duration**: The effect lasts for a limited time but can be prolonged if it spreads effectively
  * **Boss Resistance**: Bosses are more resistant to necrotism damage than regular enemies

==== Effects ====
  * Causes damage over time to affected creatures
  * Can spread from enemy to enemy under the right conditions
  * Grows stronger with each iteration
  * Can lead to chain reactions of damage in crowded areas
  * If the effect reaches the hero, it can lead to death and special badge recognition

==== Strategy for Heroes ====
  * Avoid letting necrotism reach the hero character
  * Necrotism can be used strategically to damage groups of enemies
  * Be cautious when using necrotism abilities around other enemies
  * Consider the positioning of enemies to maximize spread effects

==== Classes and Abilities ====
  * **Necromancer**: Most associated with necrotism mechanics
  * Special necromantic abilities and items may interact with necrotism
  * [[rpd:sacrificial_sword|Sacrificial Sword]] and other necromantic items may trigger or enhance necrotism
