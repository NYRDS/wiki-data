Necrotism is a harmful debuff that causes damage-over-time and spreads to nearby creatures.

==== Description ====
Necrotism is a powerful magical plague that deals damage to affected creatures and spreads to adjacent creatures. It is primarily applied through the [[rpd:necromancer_armor|Necromancer Armor]]'s special ability.

==== Damage Calculation ====
  * **Boss targets:** 1 damage per 200 HP (minimum 1)
  * **Non-boss targets:** 1 damage per max(3, (21 - iteration)) HP
  * **Final damage:** (calculated damage * iteration), minimum 1

==== Spread Mechanism ====
  * Each turn, has a 50% chance to spread from an infected creature to each adjacent creature
  * Cannot spread to Heroes or NPCs
