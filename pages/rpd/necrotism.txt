Necrotism is a harmful debuff that causes damage-over-time and spreads to nearby creatures.

==== Description ====
Necrotism is a powerful magical plague that deals damage to affected creatures and spreads to adjacent creatures. It is primarily applied through the [[rpd:necromancer_armor|Necromancer Armor]]'s special ability.

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Duration:** Base duration of 3 turns (duration constant from code)
  * **Spread:** Affects creatures in adjacent 16 neighboring cells (Level.NEIGHBOURS16 from code)
  * **Iteration:** Each spread increases the damage potency
  * **Targeting:** Affects all non-player characters (mobs and NPCs)

==== Damage Calculation ====
  * **Boss targets:** 1 damage per 200 HP (minimum 1)
  * **Non-boss targets:** 1 damage per max(3, (21 - iteration)) HP
  * **Final damage:** (calculated damage * iteration), minimum 1

==== Spread Mechanism ====
  * Each turn, has a 50% chance to spread from an infected creature to each adjacent creature
  * Cannot spread to Heroes or NPCs
  * Each spread increases the iteration counter, making subsequent damage more potent

==== Effects ====
  * **Damage Over Time:** Causes increasing damage based on target's HP
  * **Infectious Spread:** May spread from creature to adjacent creatures
  * **Visual Effect:** Purple burst effect (0x6935a5) on affected creatures
  * **Iteration Counter:** Each spread increases damage for subsequent ticks

==== Application ====
  * **Primary Source:** Activated via [[rpd:necromancer_armor|Necromancer Armor]] special ability
  * **Auto-termination:** Ends when target dies or duration expires

==== Visuals ====
  * Shows as purple/black icon in buff bar
  * Purple particle burst on affected creature each turn
