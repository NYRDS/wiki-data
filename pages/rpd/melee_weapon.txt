**Melee Weapons** are weapons designed for close combat, requiring the hero to be adjacent to enemies to attack them. These form the core of most combat in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Types of Melee Weapons ====
  * [[rpd:sword_item|Swords]] - Balanced weapons for various situations
  * [[rpd:dagger_item|Daggers]] - Fast, low-damage weapons
  * [[rpd:axe_item|Axes]] - High damage, slower weapons
  * [[rpd:mace_item|Maces]] - Good all-around weapons
  * [[rpd:spear_item|Spears]] - Long-range melee weapons
  * [[rpd:bow_item|Bows]] - Ranged weapons requiring ammunition
  * [[rpd:staff_item|Staves]] - Magical weapons with special properties
  * [[rpd:knuckles_item|Knuckledusters]] - Fast, fist-based weapons
  * [[rpd:war_hammer_item|War Hammer]] - Extremely heavy but powerful
  * [[rpd:glaive_item|Glaive]] - Long-range melee weapon

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Damage Range**: Each weapon has a minimum and maximum damage value
  * **Speed**: Affects how often the hero can attack
  * **Tier**: Determines upgrade potential and base stats
  * **Enchantments**: [[rpd:weapon_enchantments|Enchantments]] can be added for special effects
  * **Upgrading**: Weapons can be upgraded using [[rpd:scroll_of_upgrade_item|Scrolls of Upgrade]]

==== Weapon Stats ====
Weapons have several key stats:
  * **Min Damage**: Minimum damage dealt
  * **Max Damage**: Maximum damage dealt (random value between min and max)
  * **Speed**: How quickly the weapon can be used
  * **Tier**: Affects upgrade limits and base power

==== Strategy ====
  * Choose weapons that match your playstyle and hero class
  * Keep your main weapon upgraded
  * Consider weapon enchantments carefully
  * Different weapons are better for different enemies
  * Some enemies may be immune to certain types of damage

==== Upgrading Weapons ====
Weapons can be upgraded to increase their damage output. Upgrading can be done using [[rpd:scroll_of_upgrade_item|Scrolls of Upgrade]] or at the blacksmith.

==== Enchantments ====
Weapons can have [[rpd:weapon_enchantments|enchantments]] added for special effects like fire damage, stunning, or health leeching.
