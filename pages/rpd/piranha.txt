==== Strategy ====
  * Piranhas are found only in flooded treasure vaults in the Caves level
  * They're particularly dangerous due to high speed and immunity to many status effects
  * They have no EXP value so killing them doesn't contribute to experience
  * Be careful when fighting near water edges as they can escape to safety
  * Consider using ranged attacks when possible to avoid close combat

==== Obtaining ====
Piranhas can be found in the Caves level:
  * They appear in underwater areas of the dungeon
  * Always found in pools created by the PoolPainter
  * 3 Piranhas are typically spawned per pool
