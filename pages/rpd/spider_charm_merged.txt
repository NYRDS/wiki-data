According to the changelog, the Spider Charm was updated with a new sprite and now drops from the Spider Queen boss, suggesting the item has evolved in both appearance and functionality over time.

==== Strategy ====
The Spider Charm provides tactical advantages through its summoning ability, creating an additional combatant to assist in battles. However, the health cost requires careful timing of its use.
