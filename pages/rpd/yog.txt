Yog-Dzewa is the final boss in Remixed Dungeon, found in the Halls area (level 24). It is an ancient god-like entity that must be defeated to win the game.

==== Description ====
Yog-Dzewa is an ancient god-like entity that dwells in the deepest reaches of the dungeon. It has multiple components: a central brain ([[rpd:yogs_brain|YogsBrain]]), multiple eyes ([[rpd:yogs_eye|YogsEye]]) that serve as servants, a heart ([[rpd:yogs_heart|YogsHeart]]), and teeth ([[rpd:yogs_teeth|YogsTeeth]]). To defeat Yog-Dzewa, all of these components must be destroyed.

==== Boss Fight Mechanics ====
  * The fight takes place in a special arena in the [[rpd:halls|Halls]] boss level
  * When the player enters the arena, walls of fire seal the entrance
  * [[rpd:yogs_eye|YogsEye]] (the main body) spawns the other components: heart, brain, and teeth
  * All components must be defeated simultaneously to win, as they will regenerate if any component remains alive
  * Killing any component provides experience based on its level

==== Components ====
  * [[rpd:yogs_eye|YogsEye]] - The main component, a type of evil eye
  * [[rpd:yogs_brain|YogsBrain]] - A floating brain that can zap the hero
  * [[rpd:yogs_heart|YogsHeart]] - The heart component
  * [[rpd:yogs_teeth|YogsTeeth]] - The teeth component

==== Location ====
  * Found at the end of the [[rpd:halls|Halls]] level (level 24)
  * Appears in a specially designed arena for the final battle

==== History ====
Yog-Dzewa is an Old God, a powerful entity from the realms of chaos. A century ago, the ancient dwarves barely won the war against its army of demons, but were unable to kill the god itself. Instead, they imprisoned it in the halls below their city, believing it to be too weak to rise ever again.

==== Drops ====
  * [[rpd:amulet_of_yendor|Amulet of Yendor]] - The ultimate artifact needed to win the game
  * Other powerful items based on the game's level
