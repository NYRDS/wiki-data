====== Kunai ======

{{ rpd:images:kunai_item.png|Kunai Item }}

**Kunai** are throwable weapons in Remixed Pixel Dungeon. They are especially associated with the Tengu boss and ninja-themed mechanics. The Kunai is implemented as a custom item using Lua scripting, rather than Java.

==== Item Properties ====
  * **Type**: Thrown weapon/projectile (custom Lua implementation)
  * **Damage**: Random damage between level and level*2 (dmg = random(lvl, lvl*2))
  * **Accuracy Factor**: 2 (doubled accuracy when attacking)
  * **Delay Factor**: 0.5 (faster than normal attack speed)
  * **Durability**: Single use (consumed when thrown)
  * **Range**: Medium range (can hit enemies within line of sight)
  * **Stackable**: Yes, can carry multiple kunai
  * **Image**: ''ammo.png'' index 17

==== Acquisition ====
  * Dropped by [[rpd:tengu_mob|Tengu]] (boss enemy in Prison)
  * May appear in certain shops or chests
  * Can be used with the [[rpd:kunai_throw_spell|Kunai Throw Spell]]

==== Usage ====
Kunai can be used for:
  * **Offensive applications** against [[rpd:enemies|enemies]]
  * **Ranged attacks** when melee combat is difficult
  * **Conserving melee resources** during tough fights
  * **Emergency attacks** when weapons break or are unavailable
  * **Spell ammunition** for the Kunai Throw spell

==== Strategy ====
How to effectively use Kunai:
  * Best used when enemies are at medium range
  * Effective against single targets
  * Good for finishing off weak enemies
  * Useful when surrounded to attack one enemy and then escape
  * Particularly effective when used with the Kunai Throw spell (Rogue Affinity)
  * Higher damage potential due to damage formula (random between level and level*2)

==== Throwing Mechanics ====
  * Can be thrown at any visible enemy
  * Uses ranged attack mechanics with 2x accuracy bonus
  * Faster attack delay (0.5x) than normal weapons
  * Damage formula: random value between item level and item level * 2
  * Can be thrown multiple times if you have more than one kunai
