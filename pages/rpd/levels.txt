====== Levels ======

Levels are the different areas of the dungeon in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Description ====
The dungeon is divided into multiple levels, each with different environments, enemies, and challenges. As the hero progresses deeper, enemies become stronger and rewards become more valuable.

==== Level List ====
  * [[rpd:sewers_level|Sewers]] - Starting area with weak enemies
  * [[rpd:prison_level|Prison]] - An abandoned prison facility
  * [[rpd:caves_level|Caves]] - Underground caves with tougher creatures
  * [[rpd:city_level|City]] - Underground city with mechanical enemies
  * [[rpd:halls_level|Halls]] - Demon halls with the most dangerous creatures

==== Level Characteristics ====
  * **Progressive Difficulty**: Each level is more challenging than the previous
  * **Unique Mobs**: Different enemies appear at different depth levels
  * **Special Features**: Each level has unique environmental features
  * **Items and Shops**: Better items are found deeper in the dungeon
  * **Boss Fights**: Each level (except the first) has a boss at the end

==== Common Mechanics ====
  * **Stairs Down**: Find stairs to progress to deeper levels
  * **Stairs Up**: Can return to previous levels (until the hero descends further)
  * **Item Persistence**: Items don't come back once a new level is entered
  * **Unique Generators**: Each level uses different algorithms for layout
  * **Thematic Elements**: Levels have thematic designs and enemies
