====== Gnoll Armor ======

{{ rpd:images:gnoll_armor_item.png|Gnoll Armor }}

**Gnoll Armor** (also known as **Gnoll-Lieutenant Suit**) is a class-specific armor in Remixed Dungeon that can be obtained by using an [[rpd:armor_kit_item|Armor Kit]] on any regular armor while playing as the [[rpd:gnoll_class|Gnoll]] class.

==== Properties ====
  * **Type**: Class Armor
  * **Armor Class**: Medium armor
  * **Durability**: Standard for class armor
  * **Sprite**: Uses image index 25, does not cover hair, has no collar or helmet

==== Special Ability ====
**Dominate** - When activated, the wearer can attempt to dominate nearby mobs within field of view, turning them into pets. The number of mobs that can be dominated is limited by the hero's level (approximately 1 per 6 levels), and only mobs that can be pets are affected.

==== Restrictions ====
  * Only the [[rpd:gnoll_class|Gnoll]] class can equip this armor
  * Other classes attempting to wear it will receive a warning: "Only gnolls can equip the Gnoll Armor!"

==== Acquisition ====
  * Created using an [[rpd:armor_kit_item|Armor Kit]] applied to any regular armor while playing as the Gnoll class
  * Cannot be crafted directly, only transformed from existing armor
  * Also used by the [[rpd:guardian_subclass|Guardian]] and [[rpd:witch_doctor_subclass|Witch Doctor]] subclasses (same armor type)

==== Strategy ====
  * Best used on high-tier armor that has been upgraded significantly
  * Preserves all enchantments and upgrades from the original armor
  * Allows the Gnoll to benefit from class-specific abilities while maintaining armor stats
  * The Dominate ability can be used for crowd control and creating allies in battle
  * The Dominate effect is limited by the character's level, so it's more effective at higher levels
  * Consider which mobs to dominate based on their usefulness as pets
