====== Chaos Crystal ======

{{ rpd:images:chaos_crystal_item.png|Chaos Crystal Item }}

**Chaos Crystal** is an artifact in Remixed Pixel Dungeon that has the ability to "Chaos Mark" creatures. To use this ability, you must first charge the crystal (it charges when the hero takes damage). The Chaos Mark can create random effects on the chosen location, such as igniting the area or releasing a gas cloud, etc. If identified, you can fix the number of charges (up to 100 maximum). If fully identified, you can fuse it with an item (requires at least 50 charges).

==== Description ====
The Chaos Crystal is a strange and powerful artifact that channels chaotic energies. It can be worn like a ring and has two main abilities: the Chaos Mark and item fusion. The crystal charges when the hero takes damage, making it a high-risk, high-reward item.

==== Stats ====
  * **Artifact Type:** Ring-like Artifact
  * **Actions:** Use, Fuse
  * **Charging:** Crystal charges when hero takes damage
  * **Max Charges:** 100 (when identified)
  * **Fuse Requirement:** At least 50 charges and identified twice
  * **Fuseable Items:** 
    * Scrolls
    * Armor
    * Melee weapons
    * Wands
    * Shields

==== Mechanics ====
  * Charges increase when the hero takes damage (each damage instance adds 1 charge, up to 100)
  * **Chaos Mark:** When used with charges, creates a random chaotic effect at chosen location
  * **Fusion:** Can be fused with various items to create chaos-themed versions:
    * Scroll + Crystal → Scroll of Weapon Upgrade
    * Weapon + Crystal → Chaos Weapon (Sword, Bow, etc.)
    * Armor + Crystal → Chaos Armor
    * Wand + Crystal → Chaos Staff
    * Shield + Crystal → Chaos Shield
  * If cursed, using Chaos Mark will target the hero's position instead of chosen location
  * Crystal has a random glowing color when equipped

==== Usage ====
The Chaos Crystal can be used for:
  * Creating random effects in strategic locations using the Chaos Mark ability
  * Fusing with items to create powerful chaos-themed equipment
  * Risk-takers who can build up charges by taking damage strategically
  * Versatile item that can enhance other equipment through fusion

==== Strategy ====
How to effectively use the Chaos Crystal:
  * Charge the crystal by taking damage strategically (e.g., using armor with damage transfer)
  * Use the chaos mark ability to create beneficial effects in combat
  * Fuse with high-level items for the best chaos-themed replacements
  * Be careful when cursed - the chaos mark will target you instead of desired location
  * Random glowing effect makes it visually distinctive in inventory
