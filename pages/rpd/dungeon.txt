==== Dungeon Structure Details ====

  * **Graph-Based Navigation**: Dungeon connections are defined in a graph structure in Dungeon.json
  * **Depth Values**: Each level has a depth value that determines item generation and mob stats
  * **Portal Rooms**: Special transitional levels connect main dungeon sections
  * **Branching Areas**: Special levels like Spider Nests, Necropolis, and Ice Caves branch from main progression
  * **Safe Levels**: Town levels and some special buildings are marked as safe (no monsters)
  * **Music Themes**: Each area has distinct background music
  * **Size Variations**: Levels have different dimensions, from 16x16 (Spider levels) to 64x64 (Spider Boss)

==== Level Connections ====

The dungeon graph allows for non-linear exploration in some areas:
  * Spider Nest levels form a loop: 6s→7s→8s→9s→10s→6s
  * Necropolis levels form a loop: necro1→necro2→necro3→necro4→necro5→necro1
  * Ice Caves form a loop: ice1→ice2→ice3→ice4→ice5→ice1
