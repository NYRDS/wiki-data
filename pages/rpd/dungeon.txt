{{ rpd:images:caves_level.png|Dungeon}}

The **Dungeon** is the main gameplay area in Remixed Dungeon. It is a multi-level structure that players explore from top to bottom, facing increasingly difficult challenges.

==== Structure ====
The dungeon is organized into several distinct areas, each with multiple levels:

  * [[rpd:sewers_level|Sewers]] (Levels 1-5): The entry area, featuring basic monsters and simple layouts
  * [[rpd:prison_level|Prison]] (Levels 6-10): An abandoned prison with more challenging enemies
  * [[rpd:caves_level|Caves]] (Levels 11-15): Underground caverns with tougher monsters
  * [[rpd:city_level|City]] (Levels 16-20): The dungeon's center with elite enemies
  * [[rpd:halls_level|Halls]] (Levels 21-25): The deepest area with the most dangerous creatures

==== Progression ====
  * Players start at the top of the dungeon and work their way down
  * Each area concludes with a [[rpd:boss|boss fight]]
  * After defeating each boss, players receive a key to access deeper areas
  * The ultimate goal is to defeat the final boss in the Halls area

==== Features ====
  * **Procedural Generation**: Each level layout is randomly generated
  * **Scaling Difficulty**: Enemies and challenges become more difficult at deeper levels
  * **Unique Areas**: Each dungeon area has its own theme, enemies, and special features
  * **Vertical Progression**: Players must find stairs to advance between levels

==== Special Locations ====
  * [[rpd:town|Town]]: Starting location where players begin their journey
  * [[rpd:shops|Shops]]: Found randomly throughout the dungeon, selling items and services
  * [[rpd:shops|Special Rooms]]: Unique room types like gardens, libraries, and armories

==== Mechanics ====
  * [[rpd:hunger_buff|Hunger]] - Gradually increases as you descend
  * [[rpd:light|Light]] - Vision is limited without light sources
  * [[rpd:stairs|Stairs]] - Primary method of moving between levels
  * [[rpd:challenges|Challenges]] - Optional modifiers that increase difficulty for greater rewards
