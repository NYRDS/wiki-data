The Scout is the Elf's subclass in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Unlocking ====
The Scout subclass can be unlocked by using a [[rpd:tome_of_mastery|Tome of Mastery]] after defeating the second boss (Tengu).

==== Special Mechanics ====
Elven _Scouts_ gain special abilities when trampling through high grass:
  * Gain **Invisibility** for 5 turns when trampling high grass
  * High grass trampling produces fewer leaves (2 instead of 4)

==== Technical Details ====
  * **Implementation:** The Scout's special mechanics are implemented in the ''trample'' method of ''HighGrass.java''
  * **Invisibility Effect:** When a Scout tramples high grass, they gain 5 turns of invisibility
  * **Code Reference:** The specific implementation checks if the character's subclass is SCOUT

==== Special Armor ====
Using an [[rpd:armor_kit|Armor Kit]] on any armor will transform it into the [[rpd:scout_armor|Scout Armor]], which is specifically designed for this subclass.

==== Advantages ====
  * Escape dangerous situations by becoming invisible
  * Access high grass for resources while gaining stealth
  * Synergizes well with stealth-based strategies
  * Perfect for surprise attacks after emerging from grass

==== Disadvantages ====
  * Only active when trampling high grass
  * Invisibility duration is limited
  * Doesn't provide direct combat bonuses
