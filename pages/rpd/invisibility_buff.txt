{{ rpd:images:invisibility_buff.png|Invisibility }}

The Invisibility buff is a status effect in Remixed Dungeon that renders the affected character temporarily invisible to enemies.

==== Effect ====
  * **Invisibility:** The affected character cannot be seen by enemies and will not be targeted by them
  * **Duration:** Typically lasts 15 turns (duration may vary based on item quality)
  * **Detection:** Enemies lose track of the invisible character's position
  * **Visual:** The affected character appears invisible on the game screen

==== Acquisition ====
The Invisibility buff can be obtained through:
  * [[rpd:potion_of_invisibility_item|Potion of Invisibility]] - Most common source
  * [[rpd:ring_of_shadows_item|Ring of Shadows]] - Provides periodic invisibility
  * Special abilities or class features
  * Other items or spells that grant invisibility

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Combat Disruption:** Any attack or action that directly targets an enemy will immediately cancel the invisibility
  * **Wand/Scroll Use:** Using wands or scrolls while in enemy sight will break invisibility
  * **Detection:** Some special enemies may still be able to detect invisible characters
  * **Stacking:** Does not typically stack with other invisibility effects

==== Strategy ====
  * **Escape:** Essential for escaping dangerous situations
  * **Exploration:** Useful for bypassing groups of enemies
  * **Tactical:** Can be used to reposition safely
  * **Timing:** Best used when enemies are grouped or in dangerous areas
  * **Caution:** Be careful when moving near enemies as they may still detect you

==== Counters ====
  * Some enemies have special detection abilities
  * Certain area effects may still affect invisible characters
  * Physical contact with enemies breaks invisibility
