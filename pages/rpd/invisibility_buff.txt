====== Invisibility Buff ======

The **Invisibility** buff is a status effect in Remixed Dungeon that makes the hero temporarily invisible to enemies.

==== Effect Overview ====
  * **Type:** Beneficial Status Effect
  * **Duration:** 15f time units when applied via [[rpd:potion_of_invisibility_item|Potion of Invisibility]] (source: [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/watabou/pixeldungeon/actors/buffs/Invisibility.java#L14|Invisibility.java:14]])
  * **Effect:** Makes the hero invisible to enemies
  * **Cancels on:** Any action that directly targets an enemy (attack, wand use, etc.)

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Enemy Detection:** While under the effect of Invisibility, enemies cannot see the hero
  * **Pathfinding:** Enemies will lose track of the hero's position and revert to wandering behavior
  * **Combat Interaction:** Any action that targets an enemy (attack, wands, etc.) will immediately cancel the invisibility effect
  * **Passive Abilities:** Using non-targeting abilities (like throwing items at a location) will not break invisibility
  * **Visual Indicator:** Hero sprite becomes transparent while invisible
  * **Duration:** Invisibility naturally fades after 15f time units (source: [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/watabou/pixeldungeon/actors/buffs/Invisibility.java#L14|Invisibility.java:14]])
  * **Code Reference:** DURATION constant defined as 15f in the Invisibility class (source: [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/watabou/pixeldungeon/actors/buffs/Invisibility.java#L14|Invisibility.java:14]])
