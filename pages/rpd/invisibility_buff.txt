====== Invisibility Buff ======

The **Invisibility** buff is a status effect in Remixed Dungeon that makes the hero temporarily invisible to enemies.

==== Effect Overview ====
  * **Type:** Beneficial Status Effect
  * **Duration:** 20 turns when applied via [[rpd:potion_of_invisibility|Potion of Invisibility]]
  * **Effect:** Makes the hero invisible to enemies
  * **Cancels on:** Any action that directly targets an enemy (attack, wand use, etc.)

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Enemy Detection:** While under the effect of Invisibility, enemies cannot see the hero
  * **Pathfinding:** Enemies will lose track of the hero's position and revert to wandering behavior
  * **Combat Interaction:** Any action that targets an enemy (attack, wands, etc.) will immediately cancel the invisibility effect
  * **Passive Abilities:** Using non-targeting abilities (like throwing items at a location) will not break invisibility
  * **Visual Indicator:** Hero sprite becomes transparent while invisible
  * **Duration:** Invisibility naturally fades after 20 turns

==== Methods of Obtaining ====
  * [[rpd:potion_of_invisibility|Potion of Invisibility]] - The most common way to gain invisibility
  * [[rpd:ring_of_shadows|Ring of Shadows]] - Special ring that can grant invisibility
  * Some special abilities or class features may also grant this effect

  * Useful for exploring dangerous areas safely
  * Can set up ambushes after the effect wears off
  * Valuable for avoiding boss fights when health is low
  * Allows safe item usage during difficult encounters
