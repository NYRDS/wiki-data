{{ rpd:images:ring_of_frost_rings.png|Ring Of Frost }}

==== Description ====
A ring carved from magical ice that protects the wearer with a frost aura, slowing and damaging attacking enemies. This ring is worn in the [[rpd:keyring|Keyring]] slot like other artifacts.

==== Special Properties ====
  * **Frost Aura:** When worn, creates a frost aura that triggers when enemies attack the wearer
  * **Defensive Mechanism:** Applies slow and frost effects to adjacent attackers
  * **Damage Reflection:** Deals damage to attacking enemies based on ring level

==== Mechanics ====
When an enemy within 1 tile distance attacks the wearer, the ring has the following effects:
  * Applies [[rpd:slow|Slow]] effect for (Slow.duration / 5 + ring level) turns
  * Has a (10% + ring level)% chance to apply [[rpd:frost|Frost]] effect for (Frost.duration / 5 + ring level) turns
  * Deals (ring level / 2) damage to the attacking enemy

==== Identification ====
The ring starts identified when picked up, as it's an [[rpd:artifacts|Artifact]].

==== Strategy ====
  * Highly effective for melee combat where enemies will attack you directly
  * Particularly useful against enemies that rely on consecutive attacks
  * The defensive nature makes it valuable for defensive builds
  * Stack with other defensive items for maximum effectiveness
  * Level the ring to increase the chance to freeze and damage dealt
