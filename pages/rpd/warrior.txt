{{ rpd:images:warrior_sprite.png|Warrior }}

The Warrior is a melee-focused starting class with higher strength than other classes.

==== Starting Stats and Equipment ====
  * **Starting HP**: 20 (highest among all classes)
  * **Starting STR**: 11 (vs 10 for other classes)
  * **Starting Equipment**:
    * Short Sword (identified) - A unique sword that can be "reforged" to upgrade another melee weapon
    * Cloth Armor (identified) - Provides basic protection
    * 100 Gold
    * Ration (in backpack for non-expert mode)
    * Body Armor spell (in quickslot)
    * Potion of Strength (known item, already identified)
  * **Magic Affinity**: Combat

==== Class Perks ====
According to the game's string resources, Warrior class perks are:
  * **11 Strength:** Starts with 11 points of Strength (vs 10 for other classes)
  * **Unique Short Sword:** Starts with a unique short sword that can be later "reforged" to upgrade another melee weapon
  * **Food Healing:** Any piece of food restores 5 health when eaten (not applicable if HP is already full)
  * **Identified Strength Potions:** Potions of Strength are identified from the beginning
  * **Missile Disadvantage:** This perk exists only in string resources but has no actual mechanical disadvantage with missile weapons in the current code. This appears to be either a planned feature that was not implemented or outdated documentation.

==== Subclasses ====
  * [[rpd:gladiator|Gladiator]]
  * [[rpd:berserker|Berserker]]

==== Strategy ====
  * Focus on close combat and taking advantage of high health and strength
  * Invest in good armor and weapons early due to higher strength allowing use of heavy equipment
  * Use shields effectively for defense if obtained
  * Take advantage of the extra strength to use better equipment sooner
  * Consider that missile weapons are less effective for Warriors
  * Consider choosing a mastery path based on your playstyle preferences
  * Food provides additional healing when consumed
