The **Short Sword** is a basic melee weapon in Remixed Dungeon. It is the starting weapon for the Warrior class.

==== Item Overview ====

  * **Accuracy:** 1.0x (normal accuracy)

  * **Max Durability:** 12

==== Special Mechanics ====
  * **Reforge Ability:** When upgraded (level > 0), the Short Sword gains a special "Reforge" action
