==== Abilities ====
* **Bee Spawning**: When damaged, spawns 1 bee at a time (from 3-8 total possible bees)

==== Behavior ====
* **AI State**: Passive (does not actively seek targets)
* **Movement Type**: Normal (as a mob type, but doesn't move)
* **Can be a pet**: No
* **Flying**: No
* **Movable**: No (immobile structure)
* **Special Behavior**: When damaged or destroyed, activates BeeSpawner script to generate bees
* **Bee Generation**: Randomly determines 3-8 total bees to potentially spawn at the start
* **Spawn Limit**: Once the predetermined number of bees is spawned, no more bees are generated
* **Cell Selection**: Spawns bees in an empty adjacent cell (using emptyCellNextTo())

==== Drops ====
* Beehives have a 0% chance to drop items

==== Strategy ====
* Beehives are not threatening by themselves, but approaching one can trigger bee spawns
* If you need to fight near a beehive, consider taking it out quickly to prevent multiple bees from spawning
* Be careful when using area-of-effect attacks near beehives, as they can trigger multiple bee spawns
* The final swarm when the hive is destroyed can overwhelm unprepared heroes
* Beehives only spawn a predetermined number (3-8) of bees, so they're not an infinite source
* Each time the beehive is damaged, it spawns 1 bee (if any remaining bees to spawn)
* When destroyed, any remaining bees (if any) are released all at once
* Bee spawning uses the emptyCellNextTo() method, so bees appear in adjacent empty cells
* Bees are set to "Hunting" AI state when spawned, so they'll immediately target nearby enemies
