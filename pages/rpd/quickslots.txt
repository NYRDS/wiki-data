**Quickslots** are special inventory slots in Remixed Dungeon that allow the hero to quickly access frequently used items during combat or exploration.

==== Description ====
Quickslots provide rapid access to important items such as potions, scrolls, bombs, food, or other consumables without having to open the full inventory screen. The hero typically has 4 quickslots available, each of which can be assigned an item.

==== Usage ====
  * **Item Assignment:** Items can be assigned to quickslots by dragging them to the slot
  * **Quick Access:** Items can be used with a single tap during gameplay
