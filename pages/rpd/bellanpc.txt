==== Description ====
Bella is a very posh looking girl. Her whole appearance tells you "I am to good for everyone." She is encountered at the end of the game and serves as one of the possible endings.

==== Interactions ====
  * When first encountering Bella without the [[rpd:amulet_of_yendor|Amulet of Yendor]], she will tell you she bears no interest in such plebs as yourself
  * When approaching her while carrying the Amulet of Yendor, her behavior changes completely:
    * For male heroes: She will comment on your exquisite amulet and invite you for a walk to discuss your mutual future
    * For female heroes: She will note your shine and brightness compared to others, and invite you for a walk to discuss your mutual future

==== Game Ending ====
Interacting with Bella while carrying the Amulet of Yendor presents you with a choice between accepting her invitation (ending the game) or declining and continuing your adventure.
