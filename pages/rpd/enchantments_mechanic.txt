====== Enchantment Mechanics ======

==== Description ====
Enchantment mechanics in Remixed Dungeon refer to the magical properties that can be applied to weapons to enhance their combat effectiveness. These enchantments provide special effects that trigger during combat, adding an additional layer of strategy to weapon selection and upgrading.

==== Weapon Enchantments ====
Enchantments are special magical properties that can be applied to weapons. Each weapon can have at most one enchantment at a time. Enchantments can be applied when upgrading weapons with certain scrolls.

==== How Enchantments Work ====
  * Enchantments are applied to weapons using [[rpd:scroll_of_weapon_upgrade_item|Scrolls of Weapon Upgrade]]
  * A weapon can only have one enchantment at a time
  * Enchantments do not directly increase damage but provide special effects
  * When a weapon with an enchantment is upgraded, the enchantment level also increases
  * Some enchantments become more powerful at higher levels

==== Obtaining Enchanted Weapons ====
  * Use [[rpd:scroll_of_weapon_upgrade_item|Scrolls of Weapon Upgrade]] on unenchanted weapons (has a chance to add a random enchantment)
  * Find weapons with enchantments already applied in the dungeon
  * Purchase enchanted weapons from shops (rarely available)
