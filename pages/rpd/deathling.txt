====== Deathling ======

The **Deathling** is a necromantic minion that can be summoned by the [[rpd:necromancer|Necromancer]] class using the [[rpd:summon_deathling|Summon Deathling]] spell.

==== Description ====
Deathlings are temporary undead creatures created by Necromancers to serve as allies in combat. Their power scales with the hero's level, making them more valuable as the hero progresses.

==== Stats ====
* HP: Scales with hero level
* Defense: Scales with hero level
* Attack: Scales with hero level
* Speed: Moderate
* Special: Undead traits, temporary summon

==== Usage ====
Deathlings serve as expendable allies that can:
  * Tank damage for the hero
  * Engage enemies while the hero remains at a safe distance
  * Serve as a distraction during combat
  * Provide additional offensive power during difficult fights

==== Strategy ====
The number of Deathlings that can be summoned simultaneously is limited. Managing this limit effectively is crucial for Necromancer gameplay. Higher-level Deathlings become significantly more powerful and durable.
