Deathlings are undead creatures created through necromantic magic. They serve as loyal followers to the Necromancer and fight alongside them in the dungeon. According to the game description: "The Deathling is a soul of a fallen hero who was unlucky enough to be summoned by a fellow adventurer, who practices necromancy."

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Growth**: HP, damage, and defense all scale with the hero's level and magic skill level
  * **Scaling Formula**: The modifier used to calculate stats is hero.level + hero.skillLevel()*hero.skillLevel()
  * **First Action**: Stats are adjusted on first action after spawning
  * **Flying**: Deathlings are not affected by ground-based effects like roots or fire

==== Summoning ====
  * **Required Resource**: Souls (5 souls per deathling via [[rpd:necromancer_robe|Necromancer Robe]])
  * **Class**: Summoned exclusively by the [[rpd:necromancer|Necromancer]] using the [[rpd:summon_deathling|Summon Deathling]] spell
  * **Equipment**: Necromancer Robe allows summoning 1 deathling; [[rpd:necromancer_armor|Bone Armor]] allows up to 2 deathlings
  * **Limit**: Summoning is limited by Necromancer's magic level (base limit +1 per magic level)

==== Combat Abilities ====
  * **High Speed**: Moves 10% faster than standard enemies
  * **Scaling Stats**: Becomes significantly stronger as the hero advances
  * **Undead Status**: Immune to certain effects that affect living creatures

==== Strategy for Necromancers ====
  * Use Deathlings as front-line fighters to tank damage
  * Leverage their scaling stats - they become stronger as you level up
  * Upgrade hero level and magic skill level to make Deathlings more powerful
  * Use their flying ability to navigate dangerous terrain
  * Maintain sufficient souls to consistently summon Deathlings
