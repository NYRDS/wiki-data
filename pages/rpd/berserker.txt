====== Berserker ======

{{ rpd:images:hero_WARRIOR_BERSERKER.png|Berserker }}

The Berserker is the Warrior's subclass in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Unlocking ====
The Berserker subclass can be unlocked by using a [[rpd:tome_of_mastery|Tome of Mastery]]. The Tome of Mastery is typically obtained by defeating the second boss (Tengu) in the dungeon. The warrior can then choose between the Gladiator and Berserker subclasses when using the tome.

==== Special Mechanics ====
When severely wounded (below 40% health), the _Berserker_ enters a state of wild fury significantly increasing his damage output (attack damage is doubled). The Fury buff is automatically applied when the Berserker drops below 40% health while still having some HP, and wears off when the health rises above 40% again.

==== Special Armor ====
Using an [[rpd:armor_kit|Armor Kit]] on any armor will transform it into the [[rpd:berserker_armor|Berserker Armor]], which is specifically designed for this subclass.

==== Advantages ====
  * Massive damage increase when health is low (2x attack damage)
  * Can turn near-death situations into offensive opportunities
  * Very effective at finishing fights when low on health
  * Self-sustaining combat potential when in Fury state

==== Disadvantages ====
  * Only activates when severely wounded
  * Requires taking damage to reach the berserker state
  * May encourage reckless play to trigger the ability

==== Strategy ====
  * Leverage the damage boost by managing health carefully
  * Try to keep health low (but not too low) to maintain the Fury buff
  * Be aware of the 40% health threshold for the Fury effect
  * Consider defensive items that allow you to take hits while maximizing Fury uptime
