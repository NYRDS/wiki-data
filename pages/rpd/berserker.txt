**Note:** This page has been moved to follow the wiki's new naming convention for hero subclass pages. Please see [[rpd:berserker_subclass|Berserker Subclass]] for the complete information about this hero subclass.

==== Old Content Summary ====
The Berserker is the Warrior's subclass in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Unlocking ====
The Berserker subclass can be unlocked by using a [[rpd:tome_of_mastery|Tome of Mastery]]. The Tome of Mastery is typically obtained by defeating the second boss (Tengu) in the dungeon.

==== Special Mechanics ====
When severely wounded (below 40% health), the _Berserker_ enters a state of wild fury significantly increasing his damage output (attack damage is doubled). The Fury buff is automatically applied when the Berserker drops below 40% health while still having some HP, and wears off when the health rises above 40% again.

==== Special Armor ====
Using an [[rpd:armor_kit_item|Armor Kit]] on any armor will transform it into the [[rpd:berserker_armor|Berserker Armor]], which is specifically designed for this subclass.

==== Advantages ====
  * Massive damage increase when health is low (2x attack damage)
  * Can turn near-death situations into offensive opportunities
  * Very effective at finishing fights when low on health
  * Self-sustaining combat potential when in Fury state

==== Disadvantages ====
  * Only activates when severely wounded
  * Requires taking damage to reach the berserker state
  * May encourage reckless play to trigger the ability
