====== Health Mechanic ======

**Health** (or Hit Points/HP) represents the amount of damage a character can take before dying. Heroes start with different base HP depending on difficulty: 30 HP on normal difficulty and 20 HP on higher difficulties. This can be increased by finding a [[rpd:potion_of_might_item|Potion of Might]] or through other game mechanics.

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Maximum HP**: The upper limit of health a character can have
  * **Current HP**: The amount of health currently remaining
  * **Restoration**: Health can be restored through various means:
    * [[rpd:potion_of_healing_item|Potion of Healing]] and similar potions
    * [[rpd:heal_spell|Heal Spell]]
    * [[rpd:ring_of_mending_item|Ring of Mending]]
    * [[rpd:wand_of_regrowth_item|Wand of Regrowth]]
    * [[rpd:herbalism|Herbalism]] (eating raw vegetables)

==== Effects on Low Health ====
  * If health reaches 0, the character dies
