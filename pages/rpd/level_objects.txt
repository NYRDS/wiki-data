====== Level Objects ======

**Level Objects** are interactive or decorative elements that can be placed on dungeon levels in Remixed Dungeon. These include traps, statues, barricades, wells, and other environmental features.

==== Description ====
Level objects are special entities that exist on dungeon levels and can interact with characters and items. They are configured through JSON files in the `levelObjects/` directory and may have custom behaviors implemented in Lua scripts in the `scripts/objects/` directory.

==== Types of Level Objects ====
  * **Traps:** Dangerous objects that activate when triggered
  * **Statues:** Decorative or interactive stone figures
  * **Wells:** Sources of special effects or benefits
  * **Barricades:** Obstacles that block movement
  * **Pedestals:** Platforms that hold items or have special properties
  * **Plants:** Level objects like Firebloom, Icecap, Sorrowmoss, etc. that can be harvested
  * **Doors:** Locked or sealed passages

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Placement:** Level objects are defined in JSON configuration files
  * **Interaction:** Many objects respond to character proximity or actions
  * **Lua Scripts:** Custom behaviors can be implemented using Lua scripts
  * **Destruction:** Some objects can be destroyed or activated
