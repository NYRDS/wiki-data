====== Spell Book ======

{{ rpd:images:spell_book_books.png|Spell Book }}

The **Spell Book** is an artifact that contains the text of a specific spell. It looks more like a compilation of assorted pages that were sewn together, than an actual book. Once read, it teaches the hero the spell it contains.

==== Description ====
A Spell Book is an artifact that contains arcane knowledge of a specific spell. When read, it permanently teaches that spell to the hero. It appears as a collection of various pages that have been sewn together.

==== Properties ====
  * **Type:** Artifact
  * **Weight:** 20
  * **Class:** All classes can use this item
  * **Use:** Contains a single specific spell
  * **Price:** 500 gold
  * **Bag:** [[rpd:scroll_holder|Scroll Holder]] (protects from burning)

==== Identification ====
After being identified, the description reveals the specific spell contained within, formatted as: "Within these pages you've discovered a full text of a "[spell_name]" spell. [spell_description]"

==== Usage ====
  * To use a Spell Book, select the "READ" action
  * Reading takes time and must be done without interruption
  * After reading, the hero permanently learns the contained spell
  * The spell book is consumed upon reading
  * The contained spell is determined when the book is generated

==== Acquisition ====
  * Found as treasure in dungeon levels, especially in treasury areas
  * Available in special shops (specifically [[rpd:town_shop_treasury|Town Shop Treasury]])
  * Dropped by certain enemies, particularly spell-casting ones like the [[rpd:shaman_elder_mob|Shaman Elder]]
  * Can appear in various dungeon areas and shops (e.g., [[rpd:spiders_treasury|Spiders Treasury]])

==== Strategy ====
  * Provides a permanent spell for the hero to use
  * Can be used to expand spell repertoire of any class
  * Particularly useful for classes with magic affinities
  * A way to learn spells that might not otherwise be available
  * Can be transmuted at [[rpd:water_of_transmutation|Water of Transmutation]] to create another Spell Book

==== Notes ====
  * Each Spell Book contains exactly one specific spell
  * The specific spell is determined when the book is generated in the game
  * Reading is an action that requires uninterrupted time
  * Once consumed, it teaches the spell permanently to the hero
  * Not to be confused with [[rpd:scrolls|Scrolls]], which are one-time use items
  * The spell name is revealed on the item when identified in the format "Spell Book (Spell Name)"
  * Protected from burning by being placed in a [[rpd:scroll_holder|Scroll Holder]]
