====== Web ======

==== Description ====
Web is a blob effect in Remixed Dungeon that slows down characters that step on it. It roots characters in place, preventing movement until the web dissipates. It's commonly created by Spinner mobs and Spider Armor.

==== Effect ====
When characters step on web:
  * **Rooting:** Characters become rooted in place, unable to move
  * **Duration:** The effect lasts until the web dissipates
  * **Movement Prevention:** Rooted characters cannot move but can still perform other actions

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Creation:** Generated by [[rpd:spinner_mob|Spinner]] mobs when they attack
  * **Spider Armor:** [[rpd:spider_armor_item|Spider Armor]] creates web fields when the wearer takes damage
  * **Persistence:** The web remains for several turns before dissipating
  * **Immunity:** Characters wearing [[rpd:spider_armor_item|Spider Armor]] are immune to web effects
  * **Dissipation:** Webs gradually disappear over time

==== Interaction ====
  * **Spinners:** [[rpd:spinner_mob|Spinner]] enemies use webs to prevent player movement
  * **Spider Armor:** Provides immunity to web effects when worn
  * **Fire:** Fire-based attacks and spells can destroy webs (though fire doesn't spread through web like it does through other terrain)
  * **Movement:** Characters rooted by web cannot move until the effect ends

==== Strategy ====
  * **Avoidance:** Be cautious when engaging spinners, as they will attempt to web you in place
  * **Spider Armor:** Provides immunity and can be useful when fighting spider enemies
  * **Patience:** If caught in web, either wait for it to dissipate or move to a different tile if possible
  * **Spinner Combat:** Fight spinners in open areas where being rooted is less disadvantageous
