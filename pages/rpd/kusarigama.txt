The Kusarigama is a unique weapon added in remix.19.2 release.

A traditional Japanese weapon combining a sickle (kama) with a chain (kusari) and a weight (fundo). This weapon offers unique combat mechanics and reach.

==== Stats ====
  * **Damage:** 3-3 (fixed damage range)
  * **Speed:** 2.0x (faster than average)
  * **Accuracy:** 1.0x (average accuracy)
  * **Range:** 2 tiles (can attack enemies at distance)

==== Special Abilities ====
  * **Pull Action:** Can pull distant enemies (up to 3 tiles away) closer using the "Kusarigama_Pull" action
  * **Range Attack:** Can hit enemies at a distance (range 2)
  * **Disorientation:** Successful hits have a 10% chance to apply the Vertigo status effect, disorienting the opponent for 3 turns
  * **Chain Visual:** When attacking an enemy 2 tiles away, a visual chain effect is drawn

==== Item Mechanics ====
  * When attacking an enemy 2 tiles away, a visual chain effect is drawn
  * The Pull action uses a ballistica cast to determine the target location
  * If an enemy is hit by the pull ability, they are moved to an adjacent tile

==== Strategy ====
  * Use the Pull action to bring distant enemies closer or reposition them
  * The range allows attacking from a safe distance in some situations
  * The 10% chance to apply Vertigo can be useful against dangerous enemies
  * The high speed allows for more frequent attacks

Kusarigama idea belongs to Yuriy Frolov winner of [[rpd:spider_nest_mob|Spider Nest]] story contest.
