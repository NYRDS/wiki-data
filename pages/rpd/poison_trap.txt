====== Poison Trap ======

The **Poison Trap** is a mechanical trap in Remixed Dungeon that inflicts the [[rpd:poison|Poison]] status effect when triggered.

==== Stats ====
  * **Poison Duration:** 4 + (dungeon depth / 2) turns
  * **Effect Range:** Single target at trap location
  * **Trigger:** Stepped on by a character (hero or mob)

==== Description ====
When a character steps on a Poison Trap, it releases toxic gas that poisons the trigger. The poison will last for 4 + (current dungeon depth / 2) turns, with the duration affected by the target's resistance (e.g., from [[rpd:ring_of_elements|Ring of Elements]]). A visual effect of poison particles bursts from the trap location when triggered.

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Effect:** Applies the Poison status effect for (4 + dungeon depth/2) turns
  * **Trigger:** Activated when any character moves onto the trap's cell
  * **Effectiveness:** Duration affected by target's poison resistance
  * **Damage:** Poison damage is (time remaining / 3) + 1 per turn
  * **Visual:** Emits poison particles when triggered

==== Strategy ====
  * **For Players:** 
    * Carry [[rpd:scroll_of_identify|Scrolls of Identify]] to recognize hidden traps
    * Use [[rpd:studded_gloves|Studded Gloves]] or other stealth equipment to avoid triggering
    * Be cautious in areas with low HP
  * **Against Enemies:** 
    * Lure enemies onto traps when possible
    * Effective for dealing sustained damage to dangerous foes
  * **Avoidance:** 
    * Watch for slightly discolored floor tiles
    * Walk carefully (press and hold) in suspicious areas

==== Location ====
  * Found throughout the dungeon on various levels
  * More common in deeper levels where poison duration is higher
  * Typically hidden under floor, appearing as slightly different colored tile
