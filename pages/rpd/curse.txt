{{ rpd:images:item_ScrollOfCurse.png|Curse Mechanic }}

**Curse** is a mechanic in Remixed Pixel Dungeon that affects items, making them difficult to remove but sometimes providing enhanced properties.

==== Description ====
Cursing is a game mechanic that can affect various items in the dungeon. When an item is cursed, it becomes bound to the hero and cannot be removed (unequipped or dropped) until the curse is cleansed. However, cursed items often gain additional properties or power.

==== Effects on Items ====
  * **Equipment:** Cannot be unequipped without being blessed first
  * **Dropping:** Cannot be dropped normally (will fail when attempting to drop)
  * **Potential Enhancement:** Some cursed items may gain additional properties or be enchanted/glyphed
  * **Persistence:** Curse remains until removed by specific means

==== Sources of Curse ====
Items can become cursed through:
  * [[rpd:curse_item_spell|Curse Item]] spell
  * [[rpd:scroll_of_curse|Scroll of Curse]] 
  * Some traps (Curse Trap)
  * Equipment from special sources like Demon Halls

==== Removing Curse ====
Curses can be removed using:
  * [[rpd:potion_of_holy_water|Potion of Holy Water]]
  * [[rpd:scroll_of_remove_curse|Scroll of Remove Curse]]
  * Bless enchantment on weapons
  * Affection glyph on armor
  * Special NPC services (if available)

==== Strategy ====
  * Cursed equipment can be beneficial if the enhanced properties outweigh the inability to remove it
  * Be careful with cursed consumables as they may not function properly
  * Plan ahead when using curse mechanics as you may not be able to undo the effect immediately
  * Some cursed items may have negative effects in addition to the binding property
