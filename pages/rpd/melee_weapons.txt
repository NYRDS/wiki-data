====== Melee Weapons ======

Melee weapons are weapons used for close combat in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Description ====
Melee weapons are items designed for close combat situations. They are used against adjacent enemies and typically offer different damage, speed, and special properties depending on the specific weapon type.

==== Common Melee Weapons ====
  * [[rpd:sword_item|Swords]] - Balanced weapons with good damage and speed
  * [[rpd:axe_item|Axes]] - High damage, slower weapons
  * [[rpd:dagger_item|Daggers]] - Fast, lower damage weapons
  * [[rpd:mace_item|Maces]] - Moderate damage with good side effects
  * [[rpd:staff_item|Staves]] - Versatile weapons with magical properties
  * [[rpd:spear_item|Spears]] - Weapons with extended reach
  * [[rpd:war_hammer_item|War Hammer]] - High damage, slow weapon
