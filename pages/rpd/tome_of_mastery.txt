{{ rpd:images:tome_of_mastery_sprite.png|Tome of Mastery }}

The **Tome of Mastery** is a special book item in Remixed Dungeon that allows certain players to select a subclass for their character after defeating the second boss (Tengu).

==== Item Overview ====
  * **Type:** Quest Item / Book
  * **Rarity:** Unique
  * **Special Effect:** Unlocks subclass selection for eligible classes
  * **Acquisition:** Dropped by the second boss (Tengu)

==== Special Mechanics ====
  * When read, the Tome of Mastery allows the player to select a subclass specific to their current class (for eligible classes)
  * **Important:** This tome does NOT work for the Necromancer and Gnoll classes (different unlocking mechanisms)
  * For eligible classes, each hero class has access to two specific subclasses (e.g. Warrior can choose Gladiator or Berserker)
  * The subclass choice is permanent and defines special mechanics and abilities for the rest of the run
  * Reading the tome is only possible after defeating the second boss to unlock the subclass option
  * Cannot be read while blinded
  * Cannot be read if player already has a subclass

==== Classes That Can Use the Tome of Mastery ====
  * **Warrior:** [[rpd:gladiator|Gladiator]] or [[rpd:berserker|Berserker]]
  * **Mage:** [[rpd:warlock|Warlock]] or [[rpd:battle_mage|Battle Mage]]
  * **Rogue:** [[rpd:assassin|Assassin]] or [[rpd:freerunner|Freerunner]]
  * **Huntress:** [[rpd:sniper|Sniper]] or [[rpd:warden|Warden]]
  * **Elf:** [[rpd:scout|Scout]] or [[rpd:shaman|Shaman]]

==== Classes That Do NOT Use the Tome of Mastery ====
  * **Necromancer:** [[rpd:lich|Lich]] or [[rpd:witchdoctor|Witchdoctor]]
    * The Lich subclass is unlocked by obtaining the [[rpd:black_skull_of_mastery|Black Skull of Mastery]] from the Lich boss
  * **Gnoll:** [[rpd:guardian|Guardian]]
    * The Guardian subclass is unlocked by healing a [[rpd:gnoll_brute|Gnoll Brute]] NPC with the town [[rpd:healer_npc|Healer NPC]]

==== Strategy ====
  * Save the tome until you've explored the second dungeon level and identified which subclass best fits your playstyle
  * Consider your current equipment and playstyle when choosing a subclass
  * Some subclasses synergize better with certain equipment or items you may have found
  * Note: If you're playing as Necromancer or Gnoll, you won't be able to use this tome
  * You can only have one subclass, so choose carefully as the decision is permanent for the run
  * The tome is automatically added to your inventory if you play with an eligible class and have the appropriate badge unlocked
