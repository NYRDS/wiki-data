The **Tome of Mastery** is a special book item in Remixed Dungeon that allows certain players to select a subclass for their character after defeating the second boss (Tengu).

==== Item Overview ====
  * **Type:** Quest Item / Book
  * **Rarity:** Unique
  * **Special Effect:** Unlocks subclass selection for eligible classes
  * **Acquisition:** Dropped by the second boss (Tengu)

==== Special Mechanics ====
  * When read, the Tome of Mastery allows the player to select a subclass specific to their current class (for eligible classes)
  * **Important:** This tome does NOT work for the Necromancer and Gnoll classes
  * For eligible classes, each hero class has access to two specific subclasses (e.g. Warrior can choose Gladiator or Berserker)
  * The subclass choice is permanent and defines special mechanics and abilities for the rest of the run
  * Reading the tome is only possible after defeating the second boss to unlock the subclass option

==== Strategy ====
