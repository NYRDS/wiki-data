==== Mechanics ====
  * **Line of Sight:** Requires clear line of sight to target
  * **Range:** Ranged weapons have a maximum effective range (typically 4-8 cells)
  * **Accuracy:** Generally lower than melee weapons, but some have special accuracy bonuses
  * **Ammunition:** Bows and crossbows require ammunition (arrows, bolts) to function
  * **No Ammunition:** The [[rpd:huntress_class|Huntress]] class can use ranged weapons without consuming ammunition
  * **Ammunition Dependent:** Requires ammunition (for bows/crossbows)
  * **Limited Range:** Most ranged weapons have limited effective range
  * **No Physical Contact Effects:** Cannot trigger effects that require melee combat
  * **Damage:** Varies by weapon type
  * **Speed:** Varies by weapon type

==== Advantages ====
  * **Safety:** Allows attacking enemies from a safe distance
  * **Control:** Can pick and choose targets without engaging all nearby enemies
  * **Tactical Options:** Can attack while in safe positions (like behind doors)
  * **Enemy Testing:** Can assess enemy strengths before engaging in melee
  * **Trap Avoidance:** No need to move adjacent to trigger traps
  * **Effective for whittling down tough enemies before engaging in melee**
  * **Critical for fighting enemies immune to physical attacks**
  * **Can be used to activate switches or other distant mechanisms**

==== Disadvantages ====
  * **Ammunition Dependent:** Requires ammunition (for bows/crossbows)
  * **Limited Range:** Most ranged weapons have limited effective range
  * **No Physical Contact Effects:** Cannot trigger effects that require melee combat
  * **Line of Sight:** Blocked by walls and other obstacles
  * **Less Damage:** Often less damage than comparable melee weapons

==== Strategy ====
  * **Ammunition Management:** Keep sufficient ammunition for ranged weapons
  * **Positioning:** Use ranged weapons from safe positions
  * **Target Selection:** Focus on most dangerous enemies first
  * **Melee Backup:** Always have a melee weapon as backup
  * **Ammo Conservation:** Don't waste ammunition on low-value targets
  * **Enemy Movement:** Consider that enemies will typically move toward you
  * **Bottleneck Usage:** Use narrow passages to limit enemy approach options
  * **Trap Consideration:** Ranged weapons allow attacking without triggering nearby traps
  * **Effective for whittling down tough enemies before engaging in melee**
  * **Useful for fighting dangerous enemies from safe positions**
  * **Ammo management is important for bow users**

==== Class Compatibility ====
  * **Huntress:** Best compatibility, gets bonuses with thrown weapons
  * **Elf:** Good compatibility, can use ranged in melee as well
  * **Rogue:** Moderate compatibility, may prefer stealth over ranged
  * **Warrior:** Moderate compatibility, primarily a melee class
  * **Mage:** Moderate compatibility, may prefer wands over weapons
  * **Necromancer:** Moderate compatibility, focuses on undead allies

==== Combat with Ranged Weapons ====
Ranged combat works similarly to melee combat but with different accuracy calculations and range limitations. Ranged attacks can be affected by accuracy items like [[rpd:ring_of_accuracy_item|Ring of Accuracy]].
