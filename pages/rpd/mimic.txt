====== Mimic ======

{{ rpd:images:mob_Mimic.png|Mimic Sprite }}

**Mimic** is a dangerous enemy that disguises itself as a treasure chest to lure unsuspecting adventurers. When approached, it reveals its true nature and attacks.

==== Properties ====
  * **HP**: (3 + depth) * 4
  * **Attack Skill**: 9 + depth
  * **Defense Skill**: 9 + depth/2
  * **Damage**: (HP/10) to (HP/4)
  * **EXP**: 2 + 2 * (depth - 1) / 5
  * **Special Ability**: Immune to Psionic Blast scroll
  * **Loot**: May drop gold during combat (Random amount from 1 to current HP)
  * **Behavior**: Mimics treasure chests until revealed
  * **Carcass**: Cannot be looted for meat (carcassChance = 0)

==== Mechanics ====
  * When a Mimic is adjacent to an enemy during its turn, it has a 1/3 chance to drop gold equal to a random value between 1 and its current HP
  * Mimics are spawned using the static method Mimic.spawnAt(pos, items), which takes the position and a list of items that were in the chest being mimicked
  * When spawning, if another character is in the target position, they will be pushed to an adjacent empty cell
  * Mimics start in Wandering AI state but immediately change to Hunting when they spawn/activate

==== Strategy ====
  * Be cautious around chests that look too convenient to find
  * Consider using ranged attacks or throwing weapons to test suspicious chests
  * Since Mimics can drop gold during combat, they can be beneficial in certain situations
  * Psionic Blast scrolls are ineffective against Mimics due to immunity
