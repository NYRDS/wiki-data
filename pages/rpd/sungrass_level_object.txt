{{ rpd:images:sungrass_level_object.png|Sungrass Level Object }}

==== Description ====
The Sungrass level object provides healing over time to any character that touches it. When a character steps on the tile containing a Sungrass level object, it begins providing a healing effect over several turns.

==== Effects ====
  * Provides healing over time to the character that touches it
  * Offers sustained health restoration
  * The healing effect continues over multiple turns
  * The level object disappears after being touched

==== Mechanics ====
  * Sungrass level objects can be found growing in the dungeon
  * They can also be grown by planting [[rpd:sungrass_seed_item|Sungrass Seeds]]
  * The healing effect occurs over a duration after touching the level object
  * Particularly valuable when health is low

==== Strategy ====
  * Sungrass level objects are extremely valuable for healing when health is low
  * They are more effective than instant healing in some situations
  * Consider saving them for when healing is most needed
  * Better than instant healing when you have time to let the effect work
