**Invisibility** is a beneficial status effect in Remixed Dungeon that makes the affected character undetectable to most enemies.

==== Effect Description ====
  * **Type:** Beneficial Status Effect (Buff)
  * **Effect:** Makes the character invisible to enemies
  * **Duration:** 15f time units
  * **Action:** Ends when performing hostile actions
  * **Visual Effect:** Character appears at 40% opacity for heroes

==== How to Obtain ====
  * From certain potions (e.g., [[rpd:potion_of_invisibility_item|Potion of Invisibility]])
  * From specific equipment with invisibility properties
  * From class abilities or spells
  * From special items in the environment

==== Mechanics ====
  * Enemies cannot see or target the invisible character
  * Attacking or using ranged weapons ends invisibility
  * Throwing items ends invisibility
  * Moving does not end invisibility, allowing safe repositioning
  * Some special enemies may still detect invisible characters
  * Increases the target's invisible counter while active (invisibility++ when attached, invisibility-- when detached)
  * Dispelling removes the buff and affects related "Cloak" buff if target has visible enemies

==== Strategy ====
  * Use to bypass groups of dangerous enemies
  * Apply before engaging tough enemies to gain tactical advantage
  * Useful for escaping dangerous situations
  * Prime time to explore unknown areas safely
  * Combine with stealth-based classes for maximum effect

==== Counters =====
  * Some enemies (like Ghouls or Wraiths) may detect invisible characters
  * Trap detection may be affected while invisible
  * Certain mechanics may still affect invisible characters
