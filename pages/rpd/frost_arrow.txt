{{ rpd:images:item_FrostArrow.png|Frost Arrow }}

**Frost Arrow** is a special ranged ammunition item in Remixed Pixel Dungeon that freezes enemies on hit.

==== Description ====
A wooden arrow with a head soaked in frozen material. When this arrow hits an enemy, it applies a freezing effect that prevents the target from acting for a short time. This is created by "moistening" a Common Arrow with a Potion of Frost.

==== Stats ====
  * **Damage:** 1-3 points
  * **Delay:** 1.0x (relative to weapon firing speed)
  * **Durability:** Single use (consumed on impact)
  * **Price:** Cannot be purchased in shops; only created through moistening
  * **Weight:** 1

==== Properties ====
  * **Type:** Throwing/Ammunition (Special)
  * **Usage:** For use with ranged weapons like bows
  * **Consumable:** Each arrow is consumed after being shot
  * **Stackable:** Can stack up to very high quantities
  * **Special Effect:** Freezes the target on hit, preventing actions temporarily

==== Creation ====
Frost Arrows can be created by using a [[rpd:potion_of_frost|Potion of Frost]] on regular [[rpd:common_arrow|Common Arrows]]. This process is called "moistening" and transforms the basic arrow into one with special properties.

==== Mechanics ====
  * When hitting an enemy, applies the Frost status effect
  * Frost completely stops the target from acting for 2-4 turns
  * Frozen targets take 50% less damage from all sources (except fire)
  * Fire damage will immediately break the frost effect
  * Does not stack with other status effects like Paralysis or Burning

==== Availability ====
  * **Creation Only:** Cannot be found as random loot; must be created by moistening
  * **Required Materials:** Common Arrow + Potion of Frost
  * **Alchemy:** Part of the game's alchemy system for creating special ammunition

==== Strategy ====
  * Excellent for interrupting dangerous enemies or bosses during their turns
  * Allows for safe attacks on frozen targets since they can't act
  * Be aware that fire attacks will break the freezing effect
  * Useful for crowd control when facing multiple enemies
  * Particularly effective against fast-moving enemies that need to be stopped
