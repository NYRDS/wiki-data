{{ rpd:images:item_FrostArrow.png|Frost Arrow }}

**Frost Arrow** is a special ranged ammunition item in Remixed Pixel Dungeon that slows enemies on hit.

==== Description ====
A wooden arrow with a head soaked in frozen material. When this arrow hits an enemy, it applies a slowing effect that reduces the target's action frequency. This is created by "moistening" a Common Arrow with a Potion of Frost.

==== Stats ====
  * **Damage:** 0-6 points
  * **Delay:** 0.75x (relative to weapon firing speed)
  * **Durability:** Single use (consumed on impact)
  * **Price:** 5 gold per arrow
  * **Weight:** 1

==== Properties ====
  * **Type:** Throwing/Ammunition (Special)
  * **Usage:** For use with ranged weapons like bows
  * **Consumable:** Each arrow is consumed after being shot
  * **Stackable:** Can stack up to very high quantities
  * **Special Effect:** Slows the target on hit, reducing action frequency

==== Creation ====
Frost Arrows can be created by using a [[rpd:potion_of_frost|Potion of Frost]] on regular [[rpd:common_arrow|Common Arrows]]. This process is called "moistening" and transforms the basic arrow into one with special properties.

==== Mechanics ====
  * When hitting an enemy, applies the Slow status effect for 5 turns
  * Slow reduces the target's action frequency, making them act less often
  * Slow effect duration: 5 turns (constant, not variable)
  * Does not stack with other status effects like Paralysis or Burning

==== Availability ====
  * **Creation Only:** Cannot be found as random loot; must be created by moistening
  * **Required Materials:** Common Arrow + Potion of Frost
  * **Alchemy:** Part of the game's alchemy system for creating special ammunition

==== Strategy ====
  * Excellent for reducing the threat level of dangerous enemies by slowing their actions
  * Useful against fast-moving enemies that act frequently
  * Good for bosses that rely on frequent actions
  * Useful for crowd control when facing multiple enemies
  * Particularly effective when combined with other damage over time effects
