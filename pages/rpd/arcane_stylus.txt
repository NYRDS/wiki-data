==== Description ====
This arcane stylus is made of some dark, very hard stone. Using it you can inscribe a glyph on armor or enchantment on a weapon, but you have no power over choosing what it will be, the stylus will decide it for you.

==== Properties ====
  * **Durability:** Single use item
  * **Class Restriction:** Can be used by all hero classes
  * **Curses:** Cannot be used on cursed items

==== Function ====
  * **Inscription:** Allows inscribing random glyphs on armor or enchantments on weapons
  * **Random Effects:** The specific glyph or enchantment is randomly determined when used
  * **Equipment Enhancement:** Improves items with magical properties
  * **Target Items:** Can be used on armor, weapons, and [[rpd:blank_scroll|Blank Scrolls]]

==== Special Interactions ====

  * **With Weapons:** Adds a random [[rpd:enchantment|enchantment]] to weapons
  * **With Blank Scrolls:** Transforms the blank scroll into a random [[rpd:scroll|scroll]]

==== Strategy ====
  * Best used on high-quality or enchanted equipment to maximize benefit
  * Consider the risks vs. rewards as effects are random - you may get a highly desirable effect or a less useful one
  * Very valuable for improving defensive equipment with useful glyphs
  * Can be used to create scrolls when none are available
  * Most effective when applied to +0 or low-level equipment to see the benefit clearly
