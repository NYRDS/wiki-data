{{ rpd:images:arcane_stylus.png|Arcane Stylus }}

The Arcane Stylus (formally known as Stylus in the game code) is a magical tool used to inscribe special properties onto armor or transform blank scrolls in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Properties ====
  * **Rarity:** Rare
  * **Weight:** 1
  * **Durability:** Single use item
  * **Class Restriction:** Can be used by all hero classes
  * **Curses:** Cannot be used on cursed items

==== Function ====
  * **Inscription:** Allows inscribing random glyphs on armor or transforming blank scrolls into random scrolls
  * **Random Effects:** The specific glyph or scroll type is randomly determined when used
  * **Equipment Enhancement:** Improves armor with magical properties
  * **Target Items:** Can be used on armor and [[rpd:blank_scroll|Blank Scrolls]]
  * **Single Action:** Uses the 'Inscribe' action to perform either function

==== Special Interactions ====
  * **With Armor:** Adds a random [[rpd:glyph|glyph]] to armor (replacing any existing glyph)
  * **With Blank Scrolls:** Transforms the blank scroll into a random [[rpd:scroll|scroll]]

==== Strategy ====
  * Best used on high-quality armor to maximize benefit from glyphs
  * Consider the risks vs. rewards as effects are random - you may get a highly desirable effect or a less useful one
  * Very valuable for improving defensive equipment with useful glyphs
  * Can be used to create scrolls when none are available
  * Most effective when applied to armor to enhance protection

==== Obtaining ====
Arcane Styluses can be found:
  * As rare drops in dungeon levels
  * In special treasure areas
  * Potentially for purchase in advanced shops
  * As rewards for completing challenging tasks
