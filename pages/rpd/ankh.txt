====== Ankh ======

{{ rpd:images:ankh_sprite.png|Ankh Sprite  }}

==== Description ====
This ancient symbol of immortality grants an ability to return to life after death. Upon resurrection all non-equipped items are lost.

==== Special Properties ====
  * Provides one-time resurrection after death
  * Upon resurrection, all non-equipped items are lost
  * Equipped items are preserved during resurrection
  * Single use item
  * Stackable (though only one is useful at a time due to loss upon resurrection)
  * No upgrade potential
  * Always identified
  * Costs 50 gold per unit

==== Notes ====
The Ankh is a powerful but risky item - it can save you from death, but at the cost of losing all your inventory items that weren't equipped. It's generally best to use it only in desperate situations.

==== Strategy ====
* Best used as a last resort when facing certain death
* Try to keep only essential items in your inventory when entering dangerous areas
* Since only equipped items are preserved, consider equipping essential items if you suspect you might die
* Don't carry multiple Ankhs since you'll lose them upon resurrection (as mentioned in Dungeon_Tips_13 string)
