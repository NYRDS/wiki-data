====== Pasty-Mimic ======

In Remixed PD, mimics can sometimes take the appearance of a big and delicious Pasty.

They can even hide in chests or on rare occasions inside of a chest-mimic.

On top of that, these creatures can fly. Cuties, aren't they?

==== Description ====
Pasty-Mimic is a type of mimic that disguises itself as a [[rpd:pasty|Pasty]]. It's a dangerous enemy that lures hungry adventurers.

==== Features ====
The speed of a pasty-mimic is slightly higher than the standard speed. When the mimic activates, he doesn't take off at once, i.e If a pasty-mimic appears on a trap or a plant - their flying ability will be activated immediately. Also when this bastard activates, the attack button does not appear immediately, but only after clicking once on the screen. Upon death the pasty-mimic drops a [[rpd:rotten_food|Rotten Pasty]].

==== Stats ====
  * **HP:** (3 + current level depth) * 5
  * **Speed:** 1.25 (faster than normal)
  * **Attack Skill:** 9 + current level depth
  * **Defense Skill:** 2 * attack skill / 3
  * **Damage:** hp/10 to hp/4
  * **Exp for Kill:** 2 + 2 * (current level depth - 1) / 5
  * **Flight:** Yes (can fly over obstacles)

==== Special Abilities ====
  * **Flight:** Can fly over all types of terrain and obstacles
  * **Mimic Behavior:** Disguises as food to trick players
  * **Rotten Pasty Drop:** Carries a Rotten Pasty in its inventory
  * **Gas Immunity:** Immune to Toxic Gas, Paralysis and Stun effects
  * **No Corpse:** Does not leave a carcass upon death (carcassChance = 0)

==== Tactics ====
  * **Identification:** Be cautious when finding unattended food items in the dungeon, as they may be mimics in disguise
  * **Attack Pattern:** Unlike other enemies, Pasty-Mimic doesn't behave passively - it will actively hunt the player once activated
  * **Immunities:** Cannot be affected by gas-based attacks, paralysis, or stun effects
  * **Loot:** Will always drop a Rotten Pasty upon death, which can be eaten but provides no nutritional value

==== Technical Details ====
  * **Java Class:** [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/watabou/pixeldungeon/actors/mobs/MimicPie.java|com.watabou.pixeldungeon.actors.mobs.MimicPie]]
  * **Implementation:** Extends the base Mob class and implements IDepthAdjustable interface
  * **AI State:** Initially passive until triggered, then switches to Hunting behavior
  * **Depth Scaling:** Stats automatically adjust based on dungeon level depth

==== Notes ====
Pasty-Mimic appears as a food item but is actually an enemy. Be careful when finding unattended food items in the dungeon, as they may be mimics in disguise.
