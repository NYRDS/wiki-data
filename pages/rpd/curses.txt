====== Curses ======

Curses are negative magical effects that can be applied to items in Remixed Dungeon, making them harder or more dangerous to use.

==== Cursed Items ====
Cursed items have negative effects when equipped:
  * **Weapons**: May attack the wielder, deal reduced damage, or have negative accuracy
  * **Armor**: May lower defense, decrease accuracy/damage of attacks, or lower evasion
  * **Rings**: May provide negative stats or drain health
  * **Wands**: May discharge randomly and uncontrollably

==== Identifying Cursed Items ====
  * Items remain unidentified until cursed status is known
  * [[rpd:scroll_of_identify_item|Scroll of Identify]] will reveal if an item is cursed
  * [[rpd:potion_of_holy_water_item|Potion of Holy Water]] can be used to test for curses
  * [[rpd:shop_of_ingredients|Shop of Ingredients]] has the Detect Curse service

==== Removing Curses ====
  * [[rpd:scroll_of_remove_curse_item|Scroll of Remove Curse]] - primary way to remove curses from items
  * [[rpd:potion_of_holy_water_item|Potion of Holy Water]] - can also remove curses
  * [[rpd:well_of_awareness|Well of Awareness]] - has a chance to remove curse
  * [[rpd:well_of_transmutation|Well of Transmutation]] - may remove curse in exchange for different item

==== Cursed Equipment Behavior ====
  * Cursed equipment cannot be removed voluntarily (except in Prismatic Prison challenge)
  * Cursed weapons may attack the hero instead of enemies
  * Cursed armor may reduce stats instead of increasing them
  * Cursed rings may apply negative effects instead of positive
