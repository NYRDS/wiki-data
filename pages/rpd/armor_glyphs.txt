====== Armor Glyphs ======

{{ rpd:images:item_ArmorTemplate.png|Armor Glyphs }}

**Armor Glyphs** are special enchantments that can be applied to armor in Remixed Dungeon. Each glyph provides unique magical effects that can be beneficial or detrimental depending on the situation.

==== Description ====
Armor glyphs are special enchantments that can be applied to armor in the game. They function similarly to weapon enchantments but have different effects specifically for armor. When upgrading armor that already has a glyph, there is a chance to lose the current glyph based on the armor's level: at +1 the chance is 0%, at +2 it's 50%, at +3 it's 67%, etc. Higher-level armor has a higher chance to lose its glyph when upgraded. Some glyphs are positive (beneficial), others are negative (harmful), and some are circumstantial (depends on the situation).

==== List of Armor Glyphs ====

==== Affection Glyph ====
The Affection glyph charms enemies temporarily when they hit the player. This glyph is a negative property as it can be unreliable and potentially dangerous.

==== Anti-Entropy Glyph ====
The Anti-Entropy glyph provides temperature protection, healing the player in cold environments and shielding them from fire damage. It's a circumstantial glyph that is beneficial in specific situations.

==== Bounce Glyph ====
The Bounce glyph reflects projectiles back at enemies. This glyph can be beneficial when fighting ranged enemies but isn't consistently useful.

==== Displacement Glyph ====
The Displacement glyph teleports the player when they take damage, moving them to a nearby safe location. While helpful for avoiding damage, it can also disorient the player in combat.

==== Entanglement Glyph ====
The Entanglement glyph creates earthroot armor around the player when they take damage, absorbing some damage but preventing movement until it wears off. It's a circumstantial glyph that trades mobility for protection.

==== Metabolism Glyph ====
The Metabolism glyph converts food to health when the player is injured. This glyph is beneficial as it helps sustain the player during combat.

==== Multiplicity Glyph ====
The Multiplicity glyph has a chance to create temporary mirror images of the player when attacked. This can be useful for survivability but adds complexity to combat.

==== Potential Glyph ====
The Potential glyph charges the player's weapon and generates energy when struck by attacks. This is generally beneficial for characters who rely on wands or other charged items.

==== Stench Glyph ====
The Stench glyph creates clouds of toxic gas when the player is hit. This is a circumstantial glyph that can harm enemies but also potentially damage allies or the player in enclosed spaces.

==== Viscosity Glyph ====
The Viscosity glyph delays damage taken until the end of the player's turn. This is beneficial as it gives players a chance to heal before the damage is applied.

==== Usage Tips ====
  * **Choosing Glyphs**: Choose glyphs that complement your playstyle and the challenges you expect to face
  * **Upgrade Strategy**: Consider the risks and benefits of upgrading armor with glyphs applied
  * **Circumstantial Effects**: Some glyphs that seem negative can become beneficial in specific situations
