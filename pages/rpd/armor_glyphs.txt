{{ rpd:images:armor_glyphs.png|Armor Glyphs }}

**Armor Glyphs** are special properties that can be added to armor to provide various defensive and utility benefits. Each armor can have at most one glyph.

==== List of Glyphs ====
  * [[rpd:affection_glyph_glyph|Affection]]: Charms attacking enemies temporarily
  * [[rpd:anti_entropy_glyph_glyph|Anti-Entropy]]: Protects against temperature effects
  * [[rpd:bounce_glyph_glyph|Bounce]]: Reflects melee damage back to attackers
  * [[rpd:displacement_glyph_glyph|Displacement]]: Teleports damage to another location
  * [[rpd:entanglement_glyph_glyph|Entanglement]]: Grows earthroot armor when attacked
  * [[rpd:multiplicity_glyph_glyph|Multiplicity]]: Creates mirror images
  * [[rpd:potential_glyph_glyph|Potential]]: Charges wands when taking damage
  * [[rpd:metabolism_glyph_glyph|Metabolism]]: Converts food into health
  * [[rpd:stench_glyph_glyph|Stench]]: Creates toxic gas clouds around the hero
  * [[rpd:viscosity_glyph_glyph|Viscosity]]: Delays damage taken over time

==== Acquisition ====
  * **Scroll of Upgrade**: Can add glyphs to armor (with random chance)
  * **Smithing**: The blacksmith can add glyphs to armor
  * **Special Items**: Some items may provide guaranteed glyphs

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Upgrading**: Upgrading an armored glyph has a chance to preserve the glyph
  * **Curses**: Cursed armor has negative glyphs that can't be removed without a Scroll of Remove Curse
  * **Level Scaling**: Some glyphs become more effective as the hero levels up
