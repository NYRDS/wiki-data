The **ServiceManNPC** is an NPC that appears in certain special areas of the dungeon. He provides a service that allows players to watch reward videos in exchange for gold rewards.

==== Description ====
The ServiceManNPC is a regular worker of local establishments who offers a service to adventurers. He requires an internet connection to operate his reward video system, and has a limit on how many times an adventurer can use his service.

==== Mechanics ====
* **Service Limit**: Players can use the ServiceManNPC's service up to (4 + Hero Level) times per game (this limit is reset when starting a new game)
* **Rewards**: Each reward video watched provides a gold reward that increases over time:
  * Base reward: 150 gold
  * Bonus: Additional 50 gold for every 5 videos watched (150, 150, 150, 150, 150, 200, 200, 200, 200, 200, 250...)
* **Internet Requirement**: Requires an active internet connection to function
* **Limit Tracking**: The number of videos watched persists across the game (static field filmsSeen)

==== Behavior ====
* When approached, the ServiceManNPC opens a window to show available reward video content
* If the limit has been reached or no internet is available, he will inform the player accordingly
* The service limit (filmsSeen) resets when starting a new game via the resetLimit() method
