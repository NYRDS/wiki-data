====== Rotten Food ======

==== Description ====
The ball of corpse dust doesn't differ outwardly from a regular dust ball. However, you know somehow that it's better to get rid of it as soon as possible. Maybe because just holding it makes you feel anxious and angry.

==== Effects When Consumed ====
When eaten, Rotten Food has a chance to release harmful gases around the consumer:

  * **Confusion Gas:** A cloud that can disorient enemies and the player
  * **Paralytic Gas:** A gas that can paralyze creatures temporarily
  * **Toxic Gas:** Harmful gas that causes periodic damage
  * **No Effect:** Sometimes has no immediate effect

==== Throwing Effects ====
When thrown, Rotten Food may trigger one of the gas effects on the target cell or may fall normally if the molder function fails.

==== Special Properties ====
  * Provides moderate hunger satisfaction (energy = (Hunger.STARVING - Hunger.HUNGRY)/2)
  * Can be purified into regular food in some cases
  * May drop from defeated enemies or be found in the dungeon

==== Notes ====
Rotten Food is generally dangerous to consume, but can be strategically thrown at enemies to potentially release harmful gases.
