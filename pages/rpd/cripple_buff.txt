====== Cripple Buff ======

**Cripple** is a negative status effect in Remixed Dungeon that reduces the affected character's movement speed.

==== Effect ====
  * **Movement Speed**: Reduces movement speed by 50% - the affected character takes twice as long to move between tiles
  * **Duration**: Temporary effect that wears off over time or with specific cures

==== How to Get Crippled ====
  * Taking certain types of damage
  * Contact with hazardous terrain
  * Being hit by specific enemies or their abilities
  * Drinking certain unidentified potions
  * Triggering specific traps

==== How to Cure Cripple ====
  * Wait for the effect to expire naturally over time
  * Use a [[rpd:potion_of_purity|Potion of Purity]] to neutralize the effect
  * Drink a [[rpd:potion_of_healing|Potion of Healing]] which heals several negative status effects including Cripple
  * Some specific items may remove the effect

==== Strategy ====
Being crippled severely limits your ability to navigate the dungeon effectively, escape from enemies, or reach stairs. If possible, use a Potion of Purity or Potion of Healing to cure the effect quickly, as being immobilized makes you vulnerable to attacks. If you must move while crippled, plan your path carefully since each move will take longer than usual.
