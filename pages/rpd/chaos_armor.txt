===== Description =====
Chaos Armor consists of blood-red plates that are sewn together with dark red chains. They irradiate chaotic energy as you touch them. It is part of the Chaos Set, which features chaotic properties and auto-upgrading mechanics.

===== Stats =====
  * **Tier:** 3 armor
  * **Required Strength:** 13
  * **Durability:** Not applicable (not upgradable)
  * **Class:** Heavy Armor
  * **Cursed:** Can be cursed like other armors

===== Special Properties =====
  * **Blood-red plates with dark red chains:** Distinctive appearance that irradiates chaotic energy
  * **Auto-Upgrading:** Upgrades itself when wearer deals damage to enemies
  * **Charge System:** Uses a charge system to control upgrade rate (requires more charges as level increases)
  * **Upgrade Decay:** May lose levels if worn at level 4+ and takes damage
  * **Not Upgradable:** Cannot be manually upgraded with Scroll of Upgrade
  * **Glyph Removal:** When armor degrades (level 4+), the glyph is removed

===== Mechanics =====
Chaos Armor has unique auto-upgrading mechanics based on code implementation:
  * When wearer deals damage to enemies, the armor gains a charge (if not cursed)
  * When charges reach a threshold (based on current level), armor upgrades (+1 level)
  * Charge threshold increases with armor level (calculated as: 5 * level^1.5)
  * When wearer takes damage and armor level is 4+, it loses a level, removes its glyph, and resets charges to the threshold for the new level
  * Image changes based on level (level 0-2: image 0, level 3-5: image 1, etc.)
  * Cursed armor cannot gain charges from dealing damage

===== Strategy =====
  * Chaos Armor provides adaptive protection that improves as you fight enemies
  * More effective in aggressive playstyles where you deal frequent damage
  * Be cautious when taking damage at higher levels (4+), as it causes degradation and glyph removal
  * Cannot be manually upgraded, so rely on combat to improve it
  * Higher levels provide better protection but require more charges to upgrade (5 * level^1.5)
  * If cursed, the armor will not gain charges from dealing damage

===== Obtaining =====
Chaos Armor can be obtained through:
  * As a rare drop from chaos-themed enemies or events
