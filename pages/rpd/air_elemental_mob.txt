====== Air Elemental ======

{{ rpd:images:air_elemental_mob.png|Air Elemental }}

Air Elementals are flying magic beings made of living air. They appear in the [[rpd:chasm_level|Chasm level feeling]], and are immune to [[rpd:bleeding_buff|Bleeding]]. They use the [[rpd:wind_gust_spell|Wind Gust spell]] to attack enemies. Though they might be weak fighters in close combat, their ranged wind breath makes them a dangerous enemy to deal with.

==== Abilities ====
  * **Flight**: Air elementals are flying creatures and can move over any terrain
  * **Wind Gust**: When attacking enemies at range, Air elementals will cast Wind Gust, pushing the target away
  * **Distance Preference**: When in hunting state and at a distance less than skillLevel() - 1 from target, will move away
  * **Range Attack**: Uses Wind Gust on distant enemies, which can cause the player to fall from bridges or other elevated areas
  * **Immunities**: Completely immune to [[rpd:bleeding_buff|Bleeding]]

==== Behavior ====
  * Air Elementals have a unique movement pattern - when they get too close to the target (distance < skillLevel - 1), they move away instead of approaching
  * They can attack from a distance (up to skillLevel range) but won't attack adjacent enemies
  * When they attack, they cast Wind Gust which creates wind particles and burst effects on the target

==== Drops ====
  * [[rpd:potion_of_levitation_item|Potion of Levitation]] (10% chance)

==== Strategy ====
  * Air Elementals use ranged [[rpd:wind_gust_spell|Wind Gust]] attacks that can push you off ledges, so be careful around [[rpd:chasm_level|chasms]]
  * They prefer to stay at a distance and will move away when you get too close
  * Their damage output is relatively low (0 to ht() / 4), making them less threatening in close combat
  * Since they fly, they can traverse any terrain and cannot be blocked by physical obstacles
  * They are immune to effects that require physical contact or ground presence
  * They can be challenging to fight in narrow corridors due to push effects
  * They move erratically due to their unique movement pattern
