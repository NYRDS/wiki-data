The Guardian is the Gnoll's subclass in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Unlocking ====
The Guardian subclass can be unlocked by using a Tome of Mastery after defeating the second boss (Tengu).

==== Special Mechanics ====
Skillful defensive knowledge allows the _Guardian_ to counterattack with a shield, making him a formidable foe for those who dare to attack this walking bastion.

When attacked while wielding a shield (in either main hand or off-hand slot), the Guardian has a chance to reflect a portion of the damage back to the attacker. The reflected damage is calculated as: (random value between 1 and skill level+1) / (skill level+3) * original damage.

==== Source Code ====
The Guardian subclass mechanics are implemented in the [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/watabou/pixeldungeon/actors/hero/HeroSubClass.java|HeroSubClass.java]] file, specifically in the defenceProc method.

==== Special Armor ====
Using an Armor Kit on any armor will transform it into the [[rpd:guardian_armor|Guardian Armor]], which is specifically designed for this subclass.

==== Advantages ====
  * Counterattack capability when using shields
  * Enhanced defensive capabilities
  * Synergizes well with shield usage
  * Creates additional damage when attacked while using shield

==== Disadvantages ====
  * Requires a shield for the subclass mechanics to work
  * More defensive than offensive focused
  * Only works when defending with a shield
