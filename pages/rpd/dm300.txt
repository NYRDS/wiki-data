{{ rpd:images:dm300_sprite.png|DM-300 }}

DM-300 (Dwarf Machine Model 300) was originally built by the dwarves for mining operations in the deep caves. However, after the decline of the Dwarven Metropolis, it has become a guardian of the caves that attacks any intruders. It's an enormous mechanical construct with devastating attacks.

==== Description ====
This machine was created by the dwarves several centuries ago. Later, the dwarves began to replace machines with golems, elementals and even demons. Eventually this led their civilization to decline. The DM-300 and similar machines were typically used for construction and mining, and in some cases, for the defense of the city.
