====== Tips and Tricks for New Players ======

This page contains essential tips for new players starting their journey in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Early Game Strategy ====
  * **Conserve Resources**: Potions, scrolls, and other consumables are rare in the early game. Use them wisely, especially healing potions during minor fights.
  * **Identify Important Items**: Use scrolls of Identify on important equipment or items with unknown effects rather than on basic weapons/armor.
  * **Explore Thoroughly**: Search each level completely before moving on. Look for hidden rooms and secret doors (search near walls).
  * **Manage Hunger**: Keep an eye on your hunger status. Food becomes increasingly important as you descend deeper.
  * **Read Scroll Effects**: Most scrolls have utility functions. For example, Magic Mapping reveals the entire level layout.

==== Combat Tips ====
  * **Retreat When Needed**: Don't be afraid to run from difficult enemies. You can always come back later when you're stronger.
  * **Use Terrain**: Corridors can help you fight enemies one at a time. Doorways can be used to rest between battles while blocking enemy movement.
  * **Understand Enemy Stats**: Pay attention to enemy attack ratings vs. your defense. If you take too much damage, consider using food to heal or retreating.
  * **Close Range**: Melee heroes should try to attack from close range for maximum effectiveness.

==== Item Management ====
  * **Enchanting Weapons**: Enchanted weapons provide special effects (like Shock for lightning damage or Lucky for critical hits). Identify them to see the benefit.
  * **Armor Glyphs**: Similar to weapons, armor can have glyphs that provide special effects. Some glyphs are defensive, others offensive.
  * **Strength Requirements**: Equipment has strength requirements. Don't over-encumber yourself with things you can't properly use.
  * **Quickslots**: Use quickslots for frequently used items. You can assign items to quickslots by dragging them there in the inventory screen.

==== Level-Specific Tips ====
  * **Sewers (Levels 1-5)**: Focus on upgrading equipment. The Goo fight requires careful positioning and timing.
  * **Prison (Levels 6-10)**: Be wary of cursed items. The Tengu fight is unique - pay attention to its special mechanics.
  * **Caves (Levels 11-15)**: Watch out for explosions from burning gas. The DM-300 fight is a chase sequence.
  * **City (Levels 16-20)**: Be aware of various NPC types. The King fight involves additional summoned undead.
  * **Halls (Levels 21-25)**: High-level enemies here are very dangerous. Prepare thoroughly before descending.

==== Hero Class Considerations ====
  * **Warrior**: Starts with a unique short sword that can be transferred to other classes. Has a small strength advantage.
  * **Mage**: The starter wand of magic missile is very effective if upgraded. The wand can be recharged by gaining levels.
  * **Rogue**: Has perfect information about the effects of food and potions. Can detect secrets and traps passively.
  * **Huntress**: Her boomerang has infinite uses but low damage early on. She has extra health points.

==== Health and Safety ====
  * **Rest Between Fights**: Use doorways to block enemies while resting to recover health.
  * **Health Potions**: Don't waste healing potions on small amounts of damage. Save them for significant hits.
  * **Poison and Bleeding**: These status effects are dangerous. Identify and use neutralizing potions when affected.
  * **Avoid Chokepoints**: Be careful not to trap yourself in positions where you can't escape dangerous situations.

==== Advanced Tips ====
  * **Enchantments and Glyphs**: As you progress, aim for beneficial combinations like Sharp/Unstable weapons with Lucky enchantment, or armor with Entanglement glyph for mobility.
  * **Talents**: Starting with Hero class level 10, you can choose talents that modify your hero's performance in various ways.
  * **Quickslots**: Efficient use of quickslots can mean the difference between victory and defeat.
