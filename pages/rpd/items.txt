====== Items ======

Items are objects that the hero can carry, use, or equip in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Description ====
Items are all portable objects that the hero can interact with in the dungeon. They range from useful equipment to consumable items, keys for locked doors, quest items, and valuable treasures.

==== Item Management ====
  * **Inventory Space**: Limited to 19 slots, making item management crucial
  * **Item Prioritization**: Important to know which items to keep and which to drop
  * **Strategic Use**: Using items at the right time can make the difference between victory and defeat
