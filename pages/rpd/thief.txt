The **Thief** is a common mob found in the early levels of the dungeon. Thieves are agile and cunning enemies that often carry valuable items.

==== Description ====
Thieves were once residents of the surface world who descended into the dungeon depths. However, after extended periods far from daylight, many of them have lost their sanity and forgotten who they are and why they steal. These crazy thieves and bandits now roam the dungeon, seeking to steal whatever they can find.
