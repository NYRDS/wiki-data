==== Description ====
The Firebloom level object is a dangerous level object that deals fire damage to any character that touches it. When a character steps on the tile containing a Firebloom level object, it explodes and burns everything in the surrounding area.

==== Effects ====
  * Deals fire damage to the character that touches it
  * Also damages all other creatures in the surrounding area
  * The level object disappears after being touched
  * Provides an explosive effect that can damage multiple enemies

==== Mechanics ====
  * Firebloom level objects can be found growing in the dungeon
  * They can also be grown by planting [[rpd:firebloom_seed_item|Firebloom Seeds]]
  * The explosion affects a small radius around the level object location
  * Can be both a hazard and a tactical tool in combat

==== Strategy ====
  * Firebloom level objects should generally be avoided unless used tactically in combat
  * They can be useful for damaging groups of enemies in tight spaces
  * Consider using them when surrounded by hostile creatures
  * Be mindful of your health when using this tactic
