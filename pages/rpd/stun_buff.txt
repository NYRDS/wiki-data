====== Stun Buff ======

{{ rpd:images:buff_Stun.png|Stun Status Effect }}

**Stun** is a status effect in Remixed Pixel Dungeon that temporarily prevents the affected character from taking actions, similar to paralysis but often with different mechanics.

==== Effects ====
  * **Action Prevention**: Affected characters cannot move, attack, or use items/spells
  * **Turn Skipping**: The affected character's turn is skipped until the effect wears off
  * **Duration Reduction**: The effect duration decreases each turn until it expires

==== Causes ====
Stun can be inflicted by:
  * [[rpd:dread_knight|Dread Knight]] attacks (10% chance to apply stun)
  * Various other special mob abilities
  * Specific spells or items that cause stunning effects

==== Counters ====
  * Some creatures may have resistance to stun effects
  * Potions and items that cure status effects may remove stun
  * Some classes or subclasses may have abilities to resist or reduce stun duration
