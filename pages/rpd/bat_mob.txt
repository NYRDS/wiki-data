{{ bat_mob.png|Vampire Bat }}

The **Vampire Bat** is a flying enemy found throughout the dungeon in Remixed Dungeon, becoming common in the Caves area (levels 11-14). They are fast-moving creatures that heal themselves when they successfully hit their target.

==== Overview ====
These brisk and tenacious inhabitants of cave domes may defeat much larger opponents by replenishing their health with each successful attack. They are persistent enemies that can be difficult to defeat due to their healing ability.

  * **Leech Resistance**: Has resistance to Leech enchantment
  * **Loot**: Has a 12.5% chance to drop a Potion of Healing

==== Combat Tactics ====
Vampire Bats are aggressive flying enemies that use their speed and healing abilities to their advantage. They attempt to maintain distance while dealing damage and healing themselves with each hit. Their high speed and healing ability make them difficult to corner and defeat.

  * **Spawn Frequency**: Found in Caves area (specifically in levels 11-14 according to Bestiary.json)
  * **Group Behavior**: Usually found alone
  * **Special Variants**: No special variants

==== Strategy ====
  * Use ranged weapons or spells to attack while keeping away from other enemies
  * Try to corner or slow them down to prevent them from fleeing
  * Be careful about engaging multiple bats at once due to their healing abilities
  * Area of effect attacks work well against them
  * Avoid melee combat if possible to prevent their healing
  * Focus fire on one bat at a time to prevent multiple enemies from healing
  * Consider using non-leech damage sources to bypass their resistance to leech enchantments

==== Special Notes ====
  * Their healing ability makes them particularly challenging in prolonged encounters
  * Being flying creatures, they can't be trapped by ground-based effects
  * Their high speed allows them to quickly pursue fleeing players
  * Used in various quests and tasks (e.g., Blacksmith quest requires killing a bat with a pickaxe)
  * The Plague Doctor quest involves capturing a live vampire bat
