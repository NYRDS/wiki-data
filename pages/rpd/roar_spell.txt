  * Uses the Terror buff class with caster as the source

==== Usage ====
The Roar spell is primarily used for:
  * Frightening enemies with the Terror status effect
  * Creating opportunities to escape from dangerous situations
  * Disrupting enemies' actions as Terror prevents them from taking offensive actions
  * Supporting tactical positioning during combat

==== Classes ====
Classes with Witchcraft affinity have primary access to this spell:
  * [[rpd:gnoll|Gnoll]] - Has Roar in starting quickslot (level 1)
  * [[rpd:plague_doctor|Plague Doctor]] - Has Witchcraft affinity

==== Strategy ====
Roar is most effective when used in groups of enemies where multiple targets can be terrorized simultaneously. The duration of the Terror effect scales with the caster's level, making it more effective at higher levels. Since Terror prevents enemies from attacking, it's particularly useful when surrounded or when facing dangerous enemies.
