====== Enchantment ======

{{ rpd:images:item_ShortSword.png|Enchantment }}

An Enchantment is a special magical property that can be added to weapons in Remixed Dungeon using an [[rpd:arcane_stylus_item|Arcane Stylus]]. Each weapon can have only one enchantment, which provides special offensive or utility abilities.

==== Common Enchantments ====
  * **[[rpd:fire_enchantment_enchantment|Fire]]:** Chance to set enemies on fire on hit
  * **[[rpd:horror_enchantment_enchantment|Horror]]:** Chance to cause enemies to flee in terror
  * **[[rpd:instability_enchantment_enchantment|Instability]]:** Random enchantment effect on hit
  * **[[rpd:leech_enchantment_enchantment|Leech]]:** Heals you for a portion of damage dealt
  * **[[rpd:luck_enchantment_enchantment|Luck]]:** Increases damage with a chance for extra damage
  * **[[rpd:paralysis_enchantment|Paralysis]]:** Chance to stun enemies on hit
  * **[[rpd:piercing_enchantment_enchantment|Piercing]]:** Chance to hit additional enemies behind the target
  * **[[rpd:poison_enchantment_enchantment|Poison]]:** Chance to poison enemies on hit

  * **[[rpd:death_enchantment_enchantment|Death]]:** Chance to instantly kill non-boss enemies on hit

==== Application ====
  * Applied automatically when upgrading weapons with a [[rpd:scroll_of_upgrade_item|Scroll of Upgrade]]
  * Process is random - you don't choose which enchantment is applied
  * Once applied, the enchantment cannot be removed or changed
  * Higher-level weapons will have stronger enchantment effects
  * Higher upgrade levels increase the chance of receiving an enchantment
  * Only applies to weapons that can receive enchantments

==== Strategic Considerations ====
  * Choose weapons to enchant based on your needs and playstyle
  * Consider class synergies (e.g., Warriors benefit from damage enchantments)
  * Some enchantments are more valuable than others depending on the dungeon level
  * Risk vs. reward: you might get a highly desirable enchantment or an unhelpful one
