====== Enchantment ======

{{ rpd:images:enchantment_example.png|Enchantment }}

An Enchantment is a special magical property that can be added to weapons in Remixed Dungeon using an [[rpd:arcane_stylus|Arcane Stylus]]. Each weapon can have only one enchantment, which provides special offensive or utility abilities.

==== Common Enchantments ====
  * **Blazing:** Deals fire damage to enemies
  * **Blooming:** Causes grass to grow around the target
  * **Chilling:** Slows enemies with cold damage
  * **Dazzling:** Blinds enemies when they are attacked
  * **Electro:** Deals lightning damage to nearby enemies
  * **Holy:** Deals bonus damage to undead and demons
  * **Impassable:** Pushes enemies back when attacking
  * **Kinetic:** Stores excess damage for the next hit
  * **Leech:** Heals you when you hit enemies
  * **Luck:** Increases damage with a chance to deal extra damage
  * **Projecting:** Increases weapon reach
  * **Shocking:** Deals electricity damage to nearby enemies

==== Application ====
  * Applied using a [[rpd:scroll_of_weapon_upgrade|Scroll of Weapon Upgrade]] on weapons
  * Process is random - you don't choose which enchantment is applied
  * Once applied, the enchantment cannot be removed or changed
  * Higher-level weapons will have stronger enchantment effects
  * Unlike regular Scroll of Upgrade, this specialized version will never destroy existing enchantments
  * For unenchanted weapons, it adds a random enchantment; for already-enchanted weapons, it preserves the existing enchantment while improving the weapon's upgrade level

==== Code Reference ====
  * Java Class: [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/watabou/pixeldungeon/items/scrolls/ScrollOfWeaponUpgrade.java|ScrollOfWeaponUpgrade.java]]
  * Source Code Location: RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/watabou/pixeldungeon/items/scrolls/ScrollOfWeaponUpgrade.java
  * The upgrade method in the weapon class handles both upgrade level improvement and enchantment preservation

==== Strategic Considerations ====
  * Choose weapons to enchant based on your needs and playstyle
  * Consider class synergies (e.g., Warriors benefit from damage enchantments)
  * Some enchantments are more valuable than others depending on the dungeon level
  * Risk vs. reward: you might get a highly desirable enchantment or an unhelpful one
