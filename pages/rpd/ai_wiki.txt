====== AI Wiki Tools and Suggestions ======

This page documents suggestions for additional tools and improvements to the wiki maintenance process.

==== Current Process ====
The current process involves manual verification of wiki pages against code sources, checking for naming consistency, and ensuring all links are valid. This is a time-consuming process that could benefit from additional automation.

==== Suggested Improvements ====

**1. Automated Wiki Validation Tool**
Create a comprehensive tool that automatically:
  * Checks all wiki pages against the current codebase
  * Verifies proper naming conventions
  * Identifies obsolete information
  * Suggests or automatically adds code references
  * Verifies all links are valid

**2. Real-time Verification System**
A system that connects to the source code repository and verifies wiki page accuracy in real-time, flagging pages that need updates when code changes.

**3. Improved Red Link Detection**
Enhanced version of find_red_links.py that can:
  * Automatically suggest similar page names for links that don't exist
  * Identify content gaps where wiki pages should exist
  * Suggest content for missing pages based on code information

**4. Content Generation Tool**
A tool that can generate initial wiki page content from code definitions, which can then be refined by human editors.

**5. Automated Cross-Reference Generator**
A tool that automatically updates cross-references across related pages when a new page is created or existing page is significantly modified.

==== Process Improvements ====
  * Implement a continuous integration pipeline for wiki content that runs validation checks on each commit
  * Create templates for different entity types (items, spells, mobs, etc.) to ensure consistent information coverage
  * Develop a review system for community contributions to wiki pages
  * Add more machine-readable data (mr: namespace) for each game entity for easier automated processing
