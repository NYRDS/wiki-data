====== AI-Powered Wiki Maintenance Tools ======

This page documents AI-powered tools and processes that could enhance the Remixed Dungeon wiki maintenance workflow.

==== Current AI Workflow ====

The current AI workflow for wiki maintenance includes:

  * **Content Verification:** AI tools can verify wiki content against source code (Java, Lua, JSON, strings)
  * **Link Management:** AI can identify and fix redlinks, ensure proper linking to existing pages
  * **Content Creation:** AI can generate initial content for new wiki pages based on code analysis
  * **Format Standardization:** AI ensures consistent formatting across wiki pages

==== Suggested Additional Tools ====

===== Automated Redlink Detection =====

  * **Tool Purpose:** Automatically scan all wiki pages to identify broken internal links (redlinks)
  * **Implementation:** A Python script that parses all .txt files in the wiki, extracts double-bracket links, and checks for existence of target pages
  * **Suggested Location:** ''tools/py-tools/find_red_links.py'' - similar to existing ''find_red_links.py'' but enhanced for dokuwiki syntax

===== Code Change Monitor =====

  * **Tool Purpose:** Monitor changes in the game source code and flag wiki pages that need updates
  * **Implementation:** A script that compares Git diffs of Java/Lua/JSON files to identify changes that should be reflected in wiki content
  * **Workflow:** After code changes, run the tool to generate a report of wiki pages that may need updates
  * **Suggested Integration:** As a Git hook or CI/CD step that flags pages for review

===== Automatic Sprite Generation and Processing =====

  * **Tool Purpose:** Automatically process game sprites for wiki use when new entities are added
  * **Implementation:** Enhance existing ''scale_sprites_for_wiki.py'' with monitoring capabilities to automatically process new sprites
  * **Enhancement:** Add automatic naming conversion to match wiki page naming conventions

===== Wiki Content Validator =====

  * **Tool Purpose:** Validate that wiki pages contain required elements like code references and string resource links
  * **Implementation:** A validation script that checks for presence of GitHub links, string resource references, and other required content
  * **Validation Checks:**
    * Presence of Java/Lua source code references
    * Presence of string resource links
    * Proper entity naming conventions
    * Required tags and categories
    * Missing image references

===== Cross-Reference Generator =====

  * **Tool Purpose:** Automatically identify and create relevant cross-references between related game entities
  * **Implementation:** A script that analyzes entity relationships in code and suggests relevant links for wiki pages
  * **Example:** When a damage-dealing item is updated, suggest links to related armor/defense items

===== Content Freshness Tracker =====

  * **Tool Purpose:** Track how recently wiki pages were updated relative to code changes
  * **Implementation:** Compare the last edit date of wiki pages with the last commit affecting relevant code parts
  * **Output:** Generate a report highlighting pages that may need updating

==== Best Practices for AI-Assisted Wiki Maintenance ====

  * **Verification First:** Always verify AI-generated content against actual source code before publishing
  * **Incremental Updates:** Process wiki updates in small batches rather than large sweeping changes
  * **Code References:** Include direct GitHub permalinks to relevant code sections in all entity pages
  * **Machine-Readable Pages:** Maintain ''mr:'' namespace pages with raw data that can be used by AI tools
  * **Consistent Naming:** Ensure all pages follow the established naming conventions with entity type suffixes

==== Implementation Priority ====

===== High Priority: =====
  * Enhanced redlink detection with automatic suggestions
  * Content freshness tracker
  * Automated sprite processing

===== Medium Priority: =====
  * Code change monitor
  * Cross-reference generator

===== Low Priority: =====
  * Full content validator (may be too rigid for creative content)

==== Future Directions ====

  * **AI-Powered Content Generation:** Tools that can automatically generate basic wiki content from JSON configurations
  * **Multilingual Support:** AI tools that can assist with translations and keep multiple language versions synchronized
  * **Automated Testing:** Integration of wiki content verification into CI/CD pipelines for the game codebase
