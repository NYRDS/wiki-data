====== AI Wiki Documentation and Tool Suggestions ======

This page documents the tools, methodologies, and best practices used in the AI-assisted wiki maintenance process for Remixed Dungeon.

==== Tools Used ====

===== Code Search and Analysis =====
  * **grep_search**: Used extensively to find specific code implementations, string resources, and configuration files across the codebase
  * **read_file**: Utilized to examine the actual implementation of game entities in Java, Lua, JSON, and XML files
  * **read_many_files**: Used when needed to understand multiple related files simultaneously

===== Wiki Maintenance Tools =====
  * **find_red_links.py**: Python script to identify red links in the wiki data
  * **scale_sprites_for_wiki.py**: Enhances sprites for better wiki visualization
  * **check_broken_images.py**: Checks for broken image links in wiki pages

==== Methodology for Wiki Page Creation and Verification ====

===== Process for Creating/Updating Wiki Pages =====
  1. **Research**: Use grep_search to locate relevant code, JSON configs, and string resources
  2. **Implementation Analysis**: Read Java files to understand game mechanics
  3. **Lua Script Review**: Examine Lua scripts for moddable entities
  4. **JSON Configuration Review**: Check JSON files for entity definitions
  5. **String Resources**: Find localized text in XML files
  6. **Create/Update Page**: Write comprehensive wiki page based on discovered information
  7. **Cross-reference**: Link related pages appropriately
  8. **Verify**: Ensure all information is accurate and up-to-date

===== Information Sources =====
Each wiki page should reference:
  * Java implementation files
  * Lua scripts for moddable entities
  * JSON configuration files
  * String resources (with specific line numbers when possible)
  * Image resources
  * Related game entities

==== Page Structure Recommendations ====

===== Standard Sections for Game Entity Pages =====
  * **Description**: What the entity is in-game
  * **Stats**: Numerical values (with depth-scaling when applicable)
  * **Special Abilities**: Unique mechanics and behaviors
  * **Loot**: Items dropped or obtained
  * **Strategy**: How to interact with the entity effectively
  * **Technical Details**: Links to source code
  * **Code References**: Direct links to relevant code files
  * **See Also**: Related entities and concepts

===== Naming Conventions =====
  * Use snake_case for all wiki page names
  * Use entity type suffixes (e.g., _mob, _item, _spell, _buff, _class, _subclass)
  * Maintain consistency with existing page naming

==== Special Considerations for MR Namespace Pages ====

Machine-readable namespace pages (mr:) should contain:
  * Entity kind identifiers used in getEntityKind() method
  * Raw code excerpts
  * JSON configuration files content
  * Lua script code
  * String resource keys and values
  * Direct file paths to implementations

==== Common Issues Found and Resolved ====

===== Obsolete Information =====
  * Stats that don't reflect depth scaling
  * Old ability descriptions that don't match current implementations
  * Incorrect item drops or probabilities
  * Wrong immunities, resistances or vulnerabilities

===== Red Links =====
  * Create missing pages for referenced entities
  * Ensure proper cross-linking between related pages
  * Use correct namespace and naming conventions

===== Inconsistent Information =====
  * Different pages having conflicting information about the same entity
  * Outdated strategy sections that no longer apply to current game mechanics

==== Suggested Automation Tools ====

===== Potential AI-Assisted Tools =====

  * **Cross-Reference Suggester**: Identifies related entities that should be linked from a wiki page
  * **Code Change Tracker**: Monitors changes in game code and flags wiki pages that may need updating

===== Proposed Workflow Improvements =====
  * Integrate wiki validation into the build process
  * Create automatic detection for new game entities that need wiki pages
  * Develop templates for different types of game entities to ensure consistency

===== AI-Assisted Verification Process =====
  * **Automated Code Wiki Cross-Reference Tool**: A script that automatically examines all game entities in the codebase and cross-references with existing wiki pages, flagging discrepancies or missing documentation
  * **Entity Property Extractor**: Automatically extracts specific properties from Java/Lua/JSON files and suggests updates to wiki pages based on code changes
  * **Maintenance Task Generator**: Creates structured task lists for wiki maintenance, similar to the todo system used by AI assistants working on wiki updates
  * **Image Asset Verification**: Automatically checks if wiki pages have appropriate images and suggests image updates when sprite changes occur in the codebase

===== Additional Tool Suggestions Based on Recent Maintenance Tasks =====
  * **Stat Discrepancy Detector**: Automatically detects differences between game entity stats on wiki pages versus actual code implementation (e.g., invisibility duration was found to be 15 turns in code vs 20 turns on wiki)
  * **Price Validator**: Checks item prices across wiki pages against actual code values to identify inconsistencies
  * **Starting Equipment Verifier**: Validates class starting equipment descriptions against initHeroes.json configurations
  * **Subclass Mapping Tool**: Confirms that subclass descriptions match the actual HeroSubClass enum mappings in the code
  * **MR Namespace Page Updater**: Automatically updates mr: namespace pages with current code references, string resources, and implementation details
