**Ring of Evasion** is a ring artifact in Remixed Dungeon that increases the wearer's defensive capabilities by improving their evasion.

==== Description ====
The Ring of Evasion increases your chance to dodge enemy attacks. This ring provides a significant defensive bonus by increasing your defense skill bonus when equipped and activated.

==== Stats ====
  * **Type:** Ring (Artifact)
  * **Slot:** Ring (requires Keyring to carry multiple rings)
  * **Upgradeable:** Yes
  * **Effect:** Defense skill bonus equal to ring level

==== Mechanics ====
When worn and activated, the Ring of Evasion provides:
  * **Defense Skill Bonus:** +1 to defense skill per ring level
  * This bonus directly increases the chance to dodge enemy attacks
  * The higher the ring level, the better the evasion bonus

==== Acquisition ====
  * Found in various chests throughout dungeon levels
  * Dropped by certain monsters
  * Available for purchase from the [[rpd:shopkeeper_npc|Shopkeeper]] in deeper levels

==== Usage Tips ====
  * Particularly effective for characters who rely on dodging rather than armor
  * Works well in combination with other defensive equipment
  * Higher-level rings provide significantly better evasion
  * Essential for classes with lower armor values like Mage

==== Strategy ====
The Ring of Evasion is especially valuable for heroes who prefer to avoid damage rather than absorb it. It works particularly well for characters with medium armor or no armor, and can be essential in situations with high-damage enemies that are difficult to avoid entirely.
