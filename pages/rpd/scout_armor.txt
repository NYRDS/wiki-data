====== Scout Armor ======

{{ rpd:images:item_ScoutArmor.png|Scout Armor }}

Scout Armor is the class-specific armor obtained by using an [[rpd:armor_kit_item|Armor Kit]] on any regular armor for the [[rpd:scout_subclass|Scout]] subclass of the [[rpd:elf_class|Elf]] class in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Acquisition ====
  * Use an [[rpd:armor_kit_item|Armor Kit]] on any regular armor while playing as an [[rpd:elf_class|Elf]] who has chosen the [[rpd:scout_subclass|Scout]] subclass after defeating Tengu (Boss #2)
  * Transforms the base armor into Scout Armor, preserving the DR and STR requirements of the original armor

==== Special Properties ====
  * Inherits all properties from [[rpd:elf_armor|Elf Armor]]
  * **Exclusive to Scout subclass**: Cannot be equipped by characters who are not the Scout subclass
  * **Special ability**: [[rpd:elf_armor|Elf Armor]]'s special ability (creates patches of grass/vegetation in a large area)
  * **Skill point cost**: Uses skill points equal to (max skill points/3) when activated
  * Requires sufficient skill points to use special ability
  * Preserves DR and STR requirements of original armor

==== Mechanics ====
  * Inherits the ElfArmor class which extends ClassArmor
  * The special ability creates patches of regrowth (grass/vegetation) in the visible area and around the hero
  * Skill point cost increases with hero's max skill points
  * Only accessible when subclass is Scout (HeroSubClass.SCOUT)

==== Usage ====
  * Essential armor for maximizing the effectiveness of the Scout subclass
  * Should be crafted as soon as possible after choosing the Scout subclass
  * Allows full utilization of subclass abilities through the special ability
  * Particularly useful for creating vegetation for stealth or blocking mob paths

==== Notes ====
  * Part of the subclass identity system in Remixed Dungeon
  * Class armors represent the unique nature of each subclass
  * Cannot be worn by characters who haven't unlocked the appropriate subclass
  * Inherits the base Elf armor properties and special ability
  * Created through the ClassArmor.upgrade() method which transfers properties from original armor
