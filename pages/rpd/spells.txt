====== Spells ======

**Spells** are special magical abilities in Remixed Pixel Dungeon that can be cast by heroes with magical affinities. Unlike scrolls which are consumed after use, spells can be cast multiple times using mana.

==== Magic Affinities ====
Different classes have different [[rpd:mechanics|magic affinities]] that determine their available spells:

  * **Common**: Can use spells from spell books only
  * **Elemental**: Fire, water, earth, and air-based magic
  * **Necromancy**: Death and undead-themed magic
  * **Combat**: Battle-enhancing magic
  * **Rogue**: Stealth and trickery magic
  * **Huntress**: Nature and creature-summoning magic
  * **Elf**: Natural elemental magic
  * **Witchcraft**: Gnoll-themed magic
  * **Priest**: Divine magic
  * **PlagueDoctor**: Disease and toxic magic

==== Magic Level and Spell Unlocking ====
Heroes have a Magic Level attribute that determines which spells they can unlock and how powerful those spells become. Magic Level can be increased with the Tome of Knowledge item.

These are basic spells available to various classes:

  * [[rpd:wind_gust|Wind Gust]] - Push enemies and objects away
