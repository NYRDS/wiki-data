The **Gnoll** is a playable hero class in Remixed Dungeon representing a playable version of the dungeon's gnoll enemies. This unique class has special abilities and starting equipment that reflect its gnoll nature.

==== Class Overview ====
  * **Primary Focus**: Versatile combat with special gnoll abilities
  * **Special Ability**: Unique gnoll-based mechanics and resistances
  * **Playstyle**: High strength fighter with unique limitations
  * **Magic Affinity**: Witchcraft

==== Starting Stats and Equipment ====
  * **Starting HP**: 5 (lowest of all classes)
  * **Starting STR**: 15 (highest of all classes)
  * **Starting Equipment**:
    * [[rpd:gnoll_tomahawk|Gnoll Tamahawk]] (identified)

    * 8 Darts (identified)
    * 100 Gold
    * Darts in quickslot
    * [[rpd:roar_spell|Roar]] spell (in quickslot)

==== Special Mechanics ====
  * The Gnoll has very high starting strength (15) but very low HP (5)
  * Starts without armor, making her vulnerable to damage
  * **Forbidden Actions**: Cannot read scrolls, use Tome of Mastery, or inscribe items with Arcane Stylus
  * **Friendly Mobs**: Certain Gnoll-type mobs are friendly and won't attack (Gnoll, Shaman, Brute, Shielded, ShamanElder)
  * The [[rpd:roar_spell|Roar]] spell is available in the quickslot for intimidating enemies

==== Class Abilities ====
  * **High Strength**: Highest starting strength of all classes (15), providing massive damage output
  * **Low Health**: Very fragile starting health (only 5 HP)
  * **No Armor**: Starts completely unprotected
  * **Limited Magic**: Cannot use scrolls, tomes or stylus due to non-humanoid nature
  * **Roar Spell**: Can frighten enemies with Roar spell
  * **Friendly Mobs**: Certain gnoll enemies ignore the player or are neutral

==== Class Advantages ====
  * Highest starting strength of all classes, providing massive damage
  * Special starting weapon with unique properties (doesn't disappear when thrown)
  * Roar spell can frighten enemies
  * Some gnoll-type enemies will not attack
  * Darts provide ranged options

==== Class Disadvantages ====
  * Very low starting HP (only 5) makes her extremely fragile
  * Starts without armor, increasing vulnerability
  * Cannot use beneficial scrolls for identification or upgrades
  * Cannot use Tome of Mastery to unlock subclasses (special items required)
  * Cannot inscribe items with Arcane Stylus
  * Unique limitations make it one of the most challenging classes to play

==== Subclasses ====
  * [[rpd:guardian|Guardian]]
  * [[rpd:witchdoctor|Witchdoctor]]

==== Unlocking Method ====
The Gnoll class is unlocked by healing the [[rpd:gnoll_brute|Gnoll Brute]] (found in the Caves) at the town [[rpd:healer_npc|Healer]] NPC.

==== Strategy ====
  * Level up quickly to increase survivability (low starting HP)
  * Focus on melee combat and using the Tomahawk effectively
  * Use the [[rpd:roar_spell|Roar]] spell strategically to scare enemies
  * Avoid dangerous situations due to low HP and no armor
  * Be careful with the friendly gnoll mobs - attacking them with ranged weapons will make them hostile
