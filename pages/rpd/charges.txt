====== Charges ======

Charges are a resource system in Remixed Dungeon used by certain magical items such as [[rpd:wands|wands]] and [[rpd:staff_item|staves]] to enable their special abilities.

==== Description ====
Charges represent the magical energy available in certain items. Items with charges can perform their special abilities as long as charges are available. Once charges are depleted, the item cannot be used until charges are restored.

==== Items with Charges ====
  * [[rpd:wands|Wands]] - Each wand has a specific number of charges
  * [[rpd:staff_item|Staves]] - Magical staves also use charges for special abilities
  * Some artifacts and special items may also use charges

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Charge Regeneration:** Most items gradually restore charges over time
  * **Recharge Rate:** Varies depending on the item and game conditions
  * **Activation Cost:** Different abilities may consume varying numbers of charges
  * **Maximum Charges:** Each item has a maximum charge capacity
  * **Speed of Recharge:** Recharging speed may be affected by hero's level and other factors

==== Recharge Speed ====
  * Most items recharge at a rate based on hero's level
  * Higher-level heroes tend to recharge items faster
  * Some items recharge faster than others
  * Certain conditions or status effects may affect recharge rate

==== Strategy ====
  * Conserve charges for important situations
  * Consider recharge time when planning magical item usage
  * Prioritize charging more useful wands/staves
  * Use items efficiently to maximize the value of each charge
  * Be aware of recharge rates when planning combat tactics

==== Special Mechanics ====
  * **Overcharging:** Some items can be overcharged for enhanced effects
  * **Charge Transfer:** Wands can sometimes transfer charges to staves
  * **Charge Conservation:** Some enchantments may conserve charges
  * **Instant Recharge:** Certain items or effects may instantly restore charges

==== Interaction with Gameplay ====
  * Charges affect how frequently you can use magical items
  * Planning ahead is important when relying on charged items
  * Some strategies depend on managing charge economy effectively
  * Balancing usage and recharge time is a key consideration
