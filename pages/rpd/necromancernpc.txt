The **Necromancer NPC** is a special character found in the [[rpd:prison|Prison]] level (depth 7) of Remixed Pixel Dungeon.

==== Description ====
Necromancer NPC is an immortal non-player character located in the Prison level. When players interact with him for the first time, he gives them a [[rpd:skeleton_key_item|Skeleton Key]] and delivers introductory dialogue. On subsequent interactions, he delivers random messages about necromancy.

==== Location ====
  * Found exclusively in the [[rpd:prison|Prison]] level at depth 7
  * Appears in a specific room that contains a necro exit
  * Only spawns for non-[[rpd:necromancer_class|Necromancer]] classes
  * Only spawns if the player has not yet visited the [[rpd:necropolis|Necropolis]]

==== Interactions ====
  * **First interaction:** The Necromancer gives the player a [[rpd:skeleton_key_item|Skeleton Key]] and shows an introductory dialogue
  * **Subsequent interactions:** Delivers one of several random messages about necromancy

==== Mechanics ====
  * Classified as an immortal NPC (cannot die permanently)
  * Part of the necromancy-themed content in the game
  * Connected to the [[rpd:necropolis|Necropolis]] branch via the skeleton key he provides
  * Does not spawn if the player is already a [[rpd:necromancer_class|Necromancer]]

==== Strategy ====
Interacting with the Necromancer NPC is important if you wish to access the Necropolis branch dungeon. The Skeleton Key he provides is required to enter the Necropolis from the Prison level.
