{{ rpd:images:ring_of_mending_item.png|Ring of Mending }}

==== Description ====
The **Ring of Mending** is a magical ring in Remixed Dungeon that periodically heals the wearer of minor damage. It provides a steady regenerative effect that becomes more powerful with upgrades.

==== Mechanics ====
  * Provides periodic healing while worn
  * Healing rate increases with ring level
  * Does not work while the wearer is starving
  * Base effect: Heals 1 HP every 25-35 turns (average ~30)
  * Higher levels provide faster healing

==== Stats ====
  * **Type:** Ring
  * **Effect:** Periodic healing
  * **Upgrade dependent:** Yes (higher levels = more frequent healing)
  * **Identification:** Required to see exact healing rate

==== Acquisition ====
  * Found in various chests throughout the dungeon
  * Sometimes available in shops
  * May be dropped by certain enemies
  * Occasionally found in special areas like the Goo's lair

==== Strategy ====
  * Excellent for long-term dungeon exploration
  * Particularly valuable for classes with lower healing potential
  * Works well with classes that have high durability
  * Consider combining with other HP regen methods for powerful healing
  * Less effective if you're constantly taking high damage

==== Identification ====
  * Requires identification to see exact healing rate
  * Cursed rings will cause damage instead of healing
  * Cursed rings will also disable the healing effect
