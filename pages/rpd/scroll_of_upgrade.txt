The **Scroll of Upgrade** is a magical scroll in Remixed Dungeon that generally improves equipment by increasing its level, which improves base stats.

==== Item Overview ====
  * **Type:** Scroll
  * **Rarity:** Uncommon
  * **Special Effect:** Increases the upgrade level of equipment
  * **Usage:** Single use item

==== Special Mechanics ====
  * Increases the upgrade level of targeted equipment (weapons, armor, rings)
  * Each upgrade level increases base stats (damage for weapons, defense for armor)
  * When used on enchanted weapons or glyphed armor, may potentially remove the enchantment/glyph
  * Can be used on any equipment that supports upgrading (most weapons, armor, and rings)

==== Differences from Scroll of Weapon Upgrade ====
  * **Regular Scroll of Upgrade:** General-purpose upgrade scroll that can be used on any equipment, but may destroy existing enchantments on weapons or glyphs on armor
  * **Scroll of Weapon Upgrade:** Specialized for weapons only, will never destroy existing enchantments and can add enchantments to unenchanted weapons

==== Strategy ====
  * Safe to use on non-magical equipment (weapons without enchantments, armor without glyphs)
  * Risky to use on enchanted weapons or glyphed armor due to potential loss of magical properties
  * Best for increasing base stats of equipment before applying magical properties
  * Can be combined with Scroll of Weapon Upgrade for optimal weapon enhancement

==== Obtaining ====
Scrolls of Upgrade can be found:
  * In regular dungeon levels
  * In special treasure areas
  * Potentially for purchase in shops
  * As rewards for completing tasks
