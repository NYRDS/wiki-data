{{ rpd:images:buff_Amok.png|Amok Status Effect }}

**Amok** is a status effect in Remixed Pixel Dungeon that causes affected characters to become frenzied, making them attack anything nearby indiscriminately.

==== Effects ====
  * **Frenzy**: Affected characters attack any nearby characters (allies and enemies)
  * **Movement**: Affected characters may move erratically
  * **Duration**: The effect lasts until it wears off or is cured
  * **Chaos**: Creates confusion in combat as allies may fight each other

==== Causes ====
Amok can be inflicted by:
  * [[rpd:wand_of_amok_item|Wand of Amok]]
  * Special abilities of certain mobs
  * Some curses or chaotic magic effects
  * [[rpd:monk|Monk]] class abilities (in specific contexts)

==== Counters ====
  * [[rpd:resistances|Chaos Resistance]] may prevent the effect
  * Potions and items that cure status effects may remove amok
  * Some creatures may be immune to amok effects
  * Moving away from affected characters to avoid their attacks
