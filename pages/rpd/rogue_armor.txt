**Rogue Armor** is a unique armor item that can only be created by a Rogue character using an [[rpd:armor_kit|Armor Kit]] and a tier-2 or higher armor.

==== Overview ====
Rogue Armor is a special armor that can be crafted by Rogues using an [[rpd:armor_kit|Armor Kit]]. It retains the base properties of the original armor but gains a unique special ability called "Shadow Clone" which allows the wearer to create a clone of themselves to confuse enemies and escape dangerous situations.

==== Special Ability: Shadow Clone ====
  * **Effect**: Creates a shadowy duplicate of the rogue at the target location
  * **Duration**: The clone lasts for a limited time or until it takes damage
  * **Behavior**: The clone mimics the rogue's movement for a short time, confusing enemies
  * **Cooldown**: The ability has a cooldown period before it can be used again
  * **Stealth**: The clone and rogue can become temporarily invisible

==== Creation ====
  * Requires: Any armor of tier 2 or higher + [[rpd:armor_kit|Armor Kit]]
  * Character: Only available to Rogue characters
  * Method: Use Armor Kit while the target armor is equipped

==== Benefits ====
  * Maintains the base properties of the original armor
  * Gains a powerful special ability that synergizes with Rogue gameplay
  * Provides excellent escape mechanisms and tactical options
  * Adds an element of surprise and confusion in combat

==== Strategy ====
Rogue Armor provides excellent tactical options with its Shadow Clone ability. It's particularly useful for:
  * Escaping from dangerous situations
  * Confusing groups of enemies
  * Creating diversions to split enemy attention
  * Gaining temporary invisibility to reposition
  * Safe scouting in dangerous areas
