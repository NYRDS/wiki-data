{{ rpd:images:buff_Fury.png|Fury Buff }}

**Fury** is a status effect in Remixed Dungeon that significantly increases damage output but prevents natural healing.

==== Description ====
When a character with the Berserker subclass drops below 40% of their maximum health (while still having some HP), they automatically enter a state of fury. This buff doubles their attack damage and gives their eyes a bloody red appearance.

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Damage Bonus:** Attack damage is doubled (multiplied by 2)
  * **Healing Prevention:** Natural healing from Dewdrops, Resting, and Regeneration is prevented
  * **Visual Indicator:** The character's eyes become blood red
  * **Trigger:** Automatically applied when health drops below 40% maximum while still having HP
  * **Deactivation:** Wears off when health rises above 40% maximum

==== Affected By ====
  * [[rpd:berserker|Berserker]] - The Warrior subclass that automatically gains this effect when health is low

==== Counters ====
  * Healing items like Potions of Healing still work while under the effect
  * Health restoration through other means (like certain items or abilities) will cause the buff to expire

==== Strategy ====
  * Leverage the damage bonus by engaging enemies when in fury state
  * Be cautious of the healing prevention - plan ahead if you need to retreat
  * Try to maintain lower health (but not too low) to stay in fury state for extended combat
  * Use healing potions when the fury state ends to restore health safely
