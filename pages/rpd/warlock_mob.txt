==== Description ====
The **Dwarf Warlock** is a dangerous magical enemy that represents the dwarven shift from engineering to arcane arts. When dwarves' interests shifted from engineering to arcane arts, warlocks came to power in the city. They started with elemental magic, but soon switched to demonology and necromancy.
