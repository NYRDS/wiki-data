{{ rpd:images:warlock_mob.png|Warlock Sprite }}

The **Warlock** is a magic-using mob in Remixed Dungeon, typically appearing as a dwarf warlock with advanced magical abilities. When dwarves' interests shifted from engineering to arcane arts, warlocks came to power in the city.

==== Description ====
When dwarves' interests shifted from engineering to arcane arts, warlocks came to power in the city. They started with elemental magic, but soon switched to demonology and necromancy. Warlocks are formidable spellcasters found in the deeper parts of the dungeon.

==== Stats ====
  * **HP:** 70
  * **Attack Skill:** 25
  * **Defense Skill:** 18
  * **Damage:** 12-20
  * **Armor:** 8
  * **EXP:** 11
  * **Max Level:** 21

==== Behavior ====
  * **Magic-focused:** Warlocks primarily use magical attacks rather than physical combat
  * **Teleportation Defense:** When health drops below certain thresholds (2/3 and 1/3), warlocks can blink away from attackers
  * **Blink Mechanics:** 
    * At 2/3 health remaining, warlock teleports away when taking damage that would drop them below this threshold
    * At 1/3 health remaining, warlock teleports again when taking damage that would drop below this threshold
  * **Zapping attacks:** Uses shadow bolt attacks against enemies

==== Special Abilities ====
  * **Weakness Curse:** When successfully zapping an enemy, has a 50% chance to afflict the target with [[rpd:weakness_buff|Weakness]]
  * **Damage Resistance:** Has resistance to death-related effects (Immunity to Death enchantment)
  * **Dodge mechanics:** Uses teleportation as a defensive mechanism rather than traditional dodging

==== Drops ====
  * [[rpd:potion_item|Potion]] (83% chance) - Category: Potion

==== Strategies ====
  * **Close Combat:** Warlocks are vulnerable in melee combat where they can't zap effectively
  * **Blink Disruption:** The teleportation ability can be unpredictable, so plan your positioning carefully
  * **Ranged Caution:** Be careful when engaging from range as warlocks can cast shadow bolts effectively
