====== Hero Classes ======

The **Hero Classes** are the four (or more in Remixed Dungeon) different character types that players can choose when starting a new game. Each class has its own unique starting equipment, abilities, and playstyle.

==== Available Classes ====
  * [[rpd:warrior_class|Warrior]] - The melee-focused class with high survivability
  * [[rpd:mage_class|Mage]] - The magic-focused class with healing abilities
  * [[rpd:rogue_class|Rogue]] - The stealth-focused class with high damage output
  * [[rpd:huntress_class|Huntress]] - The ranged-focused class with thrown weapons
  * [[rpd:elf_class|Elf]] - The nature magic-focused class from Remixed Dungeon
  * [[rpd:necromancer_class|Necromancer]] - The undead-summoning class from Remixed Dungeon
  * [[rpd:gnoll_class|Gnoll]] - The claw-weapon specialist from Remixed Dungeon

==== Mechanics ====
Each class has its own unique mechanics:
  * Starting equipment varies by class
  * Special abilities and passive traits differ
  * Class-specific armor is available for each class
  * Some items have varying effectiveness based on class
  * Class armor can be upgraded to mastery armor

==== Strategy ====
Choosing a class determines your early game strategy and influences your entire run. Consider your preferred playstyle when choosing:
  * Melee vs Ranged combat
  * Magic vs Physical damage
  * Defensive vs Offensive focus
  * Equipment preferences
