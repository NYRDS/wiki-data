**Warrior Armor** is the class-specific armor for the Warrior class in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Description ====
Warrior Armor is the starting armor for the Warrior class and offers the highest physical protection of all class armors. It has special abilities that can be accessed once the Warrior reaches a high enough level to use class armor.

==== Stats ====
  * **Armor Level:** High (highest among class armors)
  * **Durability:** High
  * **Speed Penalty:** Moderate
  * **Required Strength:** High (scales with armor level)

==== Special Ability ====
When the Warrior reaches a high enough level to use class armor (typically after reaching level 10), the Warrior Armor gains a special ability based on the Warrior subclass:
  * **Gladiator:** Throw weapon at enemy and move to adjacent tile
  * **Berserker:** Enter rage state, taking more damage but dealing more damage in return

==== Acquisition ====
  * **Starting Equipment:** Given to the Warrior at the beginning of the game
  * **Unique to Class:** Only the Warrior can use this armor effectively

==== Upgrading ====
  * Can be upgraded with regular scrolls of upgrade like other armor
  * The special ability activates only when the Warrior reaches the appropriate level
  * Higher-level Warrior Armor provides better protection

==== Comparison ====
  * **Highest armor value** among all class armors
  * Higher strength requirement than other class armors
  * More protective than other starting armors
  * Trades some mobility for superior protection
