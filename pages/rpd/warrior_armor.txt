**Warrior Armor** is a unique armor item that can only be created by a Warrior character using an [[rpd:armor_kit|Armor Kit]] and a tier-2 or higher armor.

==== Overview ====
Warrior Armor is a special armor that can be crafted by Warriors using an [[rpd:armor_kit|Armor Kit]]. It retains the base properties of the original armor but gains a unique special ability based on upgrading level. This armor has a special ability called "Heroic Leap" which allows the wearer to jump to a target location, damaging and stunning enemies upon landing.

  * **Damage**: Deals 6-10 damage to all adjacent enemies upon landing
  * **Stunning**: Stuns enemies for 2 turns
  * **Cooldown**: Uses 100% of hero's current HP as energy for the ability
  * **Range**: The range increases with armor level (level 0: 3 tiles, level 1: 4 tiles, level 2: 4 tiles, etc.)

==== Creation ====
  * Requires: Any armor of tier 2 or higher + [[rpd:armor_kit|Armor Kit]]
  * Character: Only available to Warrior characters
