{{ rpd:images:shortsword_sprite.png|Short Sword }}

The **Short Sword** is a basic melee weapon in Remixed Dungeon. It is the starting weapon for the Warrior class.

==== Item Overview ====
  * **Type:** Melee Weapon
  * **Tier:** 1 (lowest tier melee weapon)
  * **Damage:** 1-3 (base damage)
  * **Speed:** 1.0x (normal speed)
  * **Accuracy:** 1.0x (normal accuracy)
  * **Strength Required:** 11
  * **Max Durability:** 12

==== Special Mechanics ====
  * **Reforge Ability:** When upgraded (level > 0), the Short Sword gains a special "Reforge" action
  * **Reforge Effect:** Using the Reforge action consumes the Short Sword to upgrade another weapon and provide a Scroll of Upgrade effect
  * **Safe Upgrade:** The reforge action safely upgrades another weapon without destroying enchantments
  * **Action Time:** Takes 2 turns to complete the reforge action
  * **Cannot upgrade Boomerangs:** The reforge action specifically prevents use on boomerangs
  * **Badge Tracking:** Completing a reforge validates the item for level acquisition badges

==== Strategy ====
  * Starting weapon for Warrior class with modest but reliable stats
  * Early-game weapon that can be useful until better weapons are found
  * The reforge ability makes it valuable to keep if upgraded, as it can enhance another weapon
  * Low strength requirement makes it accessible early in the game
  * Good balance of damage and speed for early encounters

==== Acquisition ====
  * Standard starting equipment for Warrior class
  * Can potentially be found as a random drop in the dungeon
  * Available in some shops
