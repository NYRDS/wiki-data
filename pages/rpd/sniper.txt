{{ rpd:images:hero_HUNTRESS_SNIPER.png|Sniper }}

The Sniper is the Huntress's subclass in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Unlocking ====
The Sniper subclass can be unlocked by using a Tome of Mastery after defeating the second boss (Tengu).

==== Special Mechanics ====
_Snipers_ completely ignore enemy damage reduction (DR) when using a ranged weapon. This makes them particularly effective against heavily armored enemies.

==== Special Armor ====
Using an Armor Kit on any armor will transform it into the [[rpd:sniper_armor|Sniper Armor]], which is specifically designed for this subclass.

==== Advantages ====
  * Ignores enemy damage reduction (DR) when using ranged weapons
  * Particularly effective against heavily armored enemies
  * Scales well with higher-level ranged weapons
  * Maintains ranged combat advantage

==== Disadvantages ====
  * Only effective with ranged weapons
  * No damage reduction ignoring benefit when fighting with melee weapons
  * DR ignoring only applies when using ranged weapons

==== Technical Details ====
The Sniper's ability is implemented by overriding the Hero's ''ignoreDr()'' method to return true when the Hero has the Sniper subclass and is using a ranged weapon (''rangedWeapon.valid() && subClass == HeroSubClass.SNIPER'').
