====== Exhumation ======

Exhumation is a necromantic ability for the [[rpd:necromancer|Necromancer]] class that allows the performer to open graves and potentially subdue the soul of one lying within.

==== Description ====
Opening the tomb is a sinister act on its own, but not enough for someone serving Death itself. The performer of this Dark Ritual has a great chance (and it will grow with the performer's mastery) to subdue a poor soul of one lying in the grave. This ability allows Necromancers to recruit additional undead minions from burial sites.

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Location Requirement:** Must be used on a grave or burial site
  * **Success Chance:** Probability increases with the Necromancer's mastery
  * **Result:** Potentially raises a new undead minion from the grave
  * **Type:** Usually raises a basic undead creature

==== Usage ====
  * **Prerequisite:** A grave or burial site must be present
  * **Class Ability:** Exclusively for [[rpd:necromancer|Necromancer]] class
  * **Tactical:** Can add to the Necromancer's undead army
  * **Resource:** Uses existing dungeon features (graves) for advantage

==== Strategy ====
  * Look for levels with graves for this ability's maximum effectiveness
  * Particularly useful on levels with tombstones or burial themes
  * Can supplement other summoning abilities when resources are low
  * Higher success rate with increased skill level
  * Provides tactical flexibility in minion management

==== Considerations ====
  * **Location Dependent:** Only useful in areas with graves

  * **Ethical:** Reflects the dark nature of necromantic practices
