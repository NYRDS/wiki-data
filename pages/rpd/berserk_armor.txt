{{ rpd:images:berserk_armor_sprite.png|Berserk Armor }}

Berserk Armor is the class-specific armor obtained by using an [[rpd:armor_kit|Armor Kit]] on any regular armor for the [[rpd:berserker|Berserker]] subclass in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Acquisition ====
  * Use an [[rpd:armor_kit|Armor Kit]] on any regular armor while playing as a [[rpd:warrior|Warrior]] who has chosen the [[rpd:berserker|Berserker]] subclass
  * Transforms the base armor into Berserk Armor with special properties

==== Special Properties ====
  * Inherits all properties of Warrior Armor (Leap ability)
  * Exclusively usable by the [[rpd:berserker|Berserker]] subclass - cannot be equipped by other classes/subclasses
  * Inherits the helmet from Warrior Armor
  * Cover hair: Yes

==== Special Ability: Leap ====
  * Allows jumping to a targeted location
  * Stuns adjacent enemies for 3 turns upon landing (SHOCK_TIME constant)
  * Uses 1 turn of time (LEAP_TIME constant)
  * Creates dust particles at landing location
  * Causes camera shake upon landing
  * Requires selecting a target location using the cell selector
  * If the target location has an enemy, the leap will land on the closest empty adjacent cell
  * Can be used to reposition in combat or escape dangerous situations

==== Usage ====
  * Essential armor for maximizing the effectiveness of the [[rpd:berserker|Berserker]] subclass
  * Should be crafted as soon as possible after choosing the [[rpd:berserker|Berserker]] subclass
  * Allows full utilization of subclass abilities
  * Cannot be equipped by non-Warrior classes or other Warrior subclasses

==== Strategy ====
  * Use the leap ability for positioning and to control enemy spacing
  * The stun effect can give you breathing room against multiple enemies
  * Can be used to reach distant areas quickly or escape dangerous situations
  * Consider using it before engaging groups of enemies to separate them
