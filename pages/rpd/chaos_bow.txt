====== Chaos Bow ======

{{tag> rpd items}}

==== Description ====
A dreadful Bow filled with the power of Chaos. Each arrow it shoots will carry piece of chaos energy within it. But if you miss... Based on source code: ''com.nyrds.pixeldungeon.items.chaos.ChaosBow.java''

==== Stats ====
  * **Damage:** 1-? (damage factor increases with level: 1 + level * 0.3)
  * **Durability:** Not applicable (not upgradable)
  * **Strength Required:** 13 points (Tier 3 bow)
  * **Tier:** 3 bow
  * **Cursed:** Can be cursed like other weapons
  * **Accuracy Factor:** 1.0
  * **Speed Factor:** 1.0

==== Special Properties ====
  * **Chaos Energy:** Each arrow shot carries chaos energy
  * **Auto-Upgrading:** Upgrades itself when wearer deals damage to enemies
  * **Charge System:** Uses a charge system to control upgrade rate (requires more charges as level increases)
  * **Upgrade Decay:** May lose levels if worn at level 6+ and takes damage
  * **Not Upgradable:** Cannot be manually upgraded with Scroll of Upgrade
  * **Chaos Bursts:** When missing a target, causes chaos effects at the user's position

==== Mechanics ====
Chaos Bow has unique auto-upgrading mechanics based on code implementation:
  * When wearer deals damage to enemies, the bow gains a charge
  * When charges reach a threshold (based on current level), bow upgrades (+1 level)
  * Charge threshold increases with bow level (calculated as: 5 * level^1.5)
  * When wearer takes damage and bow level is 6+, it loses a level and resets charges/enchantments
  * Image changes based on level (level 0-2: image 0, level 3-5: image 1, etc.)
  * Damage factor increases with level (1 + level * 0.3)
  * On miss, creates chaotic effects at user's position (chaos mark with gas effects)
  * ''Source code verification: ownerDoesDamage(), ownerTakesDamage(), and onMiss() methods in ChaosBow.java''

==== Strategy ====
  * Chaos Bow provides adaptive damage that improves as you fight enemies
  * More effective in aggressive playstyles where you deal frequent damage
  * Be cautious when taking damage at higher levels, as it causes degradation
  * Cannot be manually upgraded, so rely on combat to improve it
  * Higher levels provide better damage but require more charges to upgrade
  * Be careful when missing shots, as it causes chaos effects at your position

==== Obtaining ====
Chaos Bow can be obtained through:
  * As a rare drop from chaos-themed enemies or events (e.g., via ChaosCrystal generator)
  * [[rpd:chaos_crystal|Chaos Crystal]] may have crafting applications (source code suggests it can be generated via ChaosCrystal selector)

==== Content Verification ====
  * Information source: ''com.nyrds.pixeldungeon.items.chaos.ChaosBow.java''
  * Stats verification: Extracted directly from ChaosBow class properties and dmgFactor() method
  * Mechanics verification: Based on ownerDoesDamage(), ownerTakesDamage(), onMiss(), and charge management methods
