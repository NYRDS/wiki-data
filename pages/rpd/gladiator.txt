The Gladiator is the Warrior's subclass in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Unlocking ====
The Gladiator subclass can be unlocked by using a Tome of Mastery after defeating the second boss (Tengu).

==== Special Mechanics ====
A successful attack with a melee weapon allows the _Gladiator_ to start a combo, in which every next successful hit inflicts more damage.

==== Special Armor ====
Using an Armor Kit on any armor will transform it into the [[rpd:gladiator_armor|Gladiator Armor]], which is specifically designed for this subclass.

==== Advantages ====
  * Can build devastating combos with melee weapons
  * The more consecutive hits, the more damage is dealt
  * Effective for sustained melee combat

==== Disadvantages ====
  * Requires consecutive hits to be effective
  * Combo is broken if a hit misses or if the Gladiator takes damage
