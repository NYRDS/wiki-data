{{ rpd:images:hero_WARRIOR_GLADIATOR.png|Gladiator Subclass }}

**Note:** This page has been moved to follow the wiki's new naming convention for hero subclass pages. Please see [[rpd:gladiator_subclass|Gladiator Subclass]] for the complete information about this hero subclass.

==== Old Content Summary ====
The Gladiator is the Warrior's subclass in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Unlocking ====
The Gladiator subclass can be unlocked by using a [[rpd:tome_of_mastery_item|Tome of Mastery]] after defeating the second boss (Tengu).

==== Special Mechanics ====
A successful attack with a melee weapon allows the _Gladiator_ to start a combo. After 2 successful consecutive hits (for a total of 3), each additional hit increases damage by an additional 20% (the damage bonus increases linearly with hit count). The combo is broken if a hit misses or if the Gladiator takes damage.

  * **Damage Bonus Formula**: (hit count - 2) / 5, meaning:
    * 3rd hit: 20% damage bonus
    * 4th hit: 40% damage bonus
    * 5th hit: 60% damage bonus
    * And so on...

==== Special Armor ====
Using an [[rpd:armor_kit_item|Armor Kit]] on any armor will transform it into the [[rpd:gladiator_armor_item|Gladiator Armor]], which is specifically designed for this subclass.

==== Advantages ====
  * Can build devastating combos with melee weapons
  * After 3 successful hits, damage increases by 20% per additional hit
  * Effective for sustained melee combat

==== Disadvantages ====
  * Requires consecutive hits to be effective
  * Combo is broken if a hit misses or if the Gladiator takes damage
