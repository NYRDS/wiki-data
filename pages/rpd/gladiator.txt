The Gladiator is the Warrior's subclass in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Unlocking ====
The Gladiator subclass can be unlocked by using a [[rpd:tome_of_mastery|Tome of Mastery]] after defeating the second boss (Tengu).

==== Special Mechanics ====
A successful attack with a melee weapon allows the _Gladiator_ to start a combo. After 3 successful consecutive hits, each additional hit increases damage by 20% per hit. The combo is broken if a hit misses or if the Gladiator takes damage.
