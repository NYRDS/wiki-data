====== Rotten Food ======
In Remixed Pixel Dungeon, food can rot if it comes into contact with toxic gas, so don't use your [[Ration]] for trap disarming. A rotten pie can drop from mimics that are disguised as one.

Food does not become rotten if it stays in your inventory for too long. Also, rotten food satisfies hunger much less than the fresh counterparts. It is not recommended to eat such food (It still can be eaten though) but you can  thrown it at an enemy with a chance that a random gas effect will occur.

By throwing a piece of rotten food, the following effects can occur:

  * A cloud of toxic gas will appear (25% chance)
  * A cloud of paralyzing gas will appear (25% chance)
  * A cloud of confusing gas will appear (25% chance)
  * Nothing will happen (25% chance)

Wise adventurers can restore rotten food to its initial state by pouring a potion of purification on it. This potion can also be used when throwing a rotten piece of food, since it blocks the effects of all gases.
