====== Ring of Stone Blood ======

Ring of Stone Blood allows adventurer wearing it to walk through solid rocks as thin air. This comes at a price of course: for each step taken inside walls, the wearer loses a portion of their health.

This artifact is unique for [[rpd:start|Remixed Pixel Dungeon]].

==== Description ====
This strange ring is made of sturdy stone. What you first thought was a ruby is actually liquid blood being held in place! Inside is an arrow pointing at what appears to be a wall, along with a broken heart... What might it do?

==== Item Class ====
* **Java Class:** [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/watabou/pixeldungeon/items/rings/RingOfStoneWalking.java|RingOfStoneWalking.java]]
* **Sprite Index:** [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/watabou/pixeldungeon/sprites/ItemSpriteSheet.java#L80|RING_OF_STONE_WALKING = 133]]

==== Special Properties ====
* **Stone Construction:** Made of sturdy stone material
* **Blood Center:** Contains what appears to be liquid blood in the center
* **Unique Design:** Features an arrow and broken heart imagery

==== Effects ====
* **Wall Walking:** Allows the wearer to walk through solid walls/rocks as if they were passable terrain
* **Health Cost:** For each step taken inside solid walls, the wearer loses damage equal to max(HP / 2, 2)
* **Stone Blood Ability:** The blood turns to stone which merges with nearby walls, making traversing them much easier, but at what cost
* **Boss Level Restriction:** The ring does not function on boss levels (the walk-through-walls ability is disabled)
* **Death Consequence:** If the player dies while using this ring, they will be immured in stone forever

==== Mechanics ====
The ring works by overriding the normal passability checks in [[rpd:hero|Hero]] movement logic. When the player attempts to move to a solid tile while wearing the ring (and not on a boss level), the move is allowed. However, each step taken in solid terrain applies damage equal to the greater of half the hero's current HP or 2 points.

==== Strategy ====
* Since the damage is based on current HP, try to reduce your HP before using the ring if you don't want to take too much damage
* The ring is most useful for bypassing obstacles, accessing hard-to-reach areas, or evading enemies
* You can drink potions inside walls without them dispersing, but be careful as this can lead to dangerous situations
* The ring does not work on boss levels, so plan accordingly for boss encounters
* Be aware that if you die while using this ring, the game will fail with "You have been immured in stone. Forever."
