====== Shields ======

**Shields** are defensive equipment items that can be equipped in the Left Hand slot in Remixed Pixel Dungeon.

==== Overview ====
Shields provide defensive bonuses and blocking capabilities when equipped in the left hand. They can be used in combination with weapons in the main hand, offering protection at the cost of some offensive capability.

==== Shield Mechanics ====
  * **Slot**: Left Hand equipment slot
  * **Function**: Provides defensive bonuses and blocking capabilities
  * **Strategy**: Offers protection at the cost of some offensive capability
  * **Compatibility**: Can be used with one-handed weapons in the main hand
  * **Block Chance**: Varies by shield level (1-4) and character strength (30%, 40%, 40%, 50% base chance)
  * **Block Damage**: Reduces incoming damage by a fixed amount (4, 6, 8, 10 base values for levels 1-4)
  * **Recharge Time**: After blocking, shields require time to recharge before the next block (base 5 turns + weight penalty)
  * **Required Strength**: Each shield level requires a minimum strength (Wooden: 12, Tough: 14, Strong: 16, Royal: 18)

==== Combat Strategy ====
Using shields changes the combat approach significantly:

  * **Offense**: Reduced attack potential compared to dual-wielding
  * **Versatility**: Can use main hand for weapons while maintaining defense
  * **Tactics**: Best for defensive playstyles or when facing numerous dangerous enemies
  * **Block Timing**: Shields must recharge after each block, so timing is crucial
