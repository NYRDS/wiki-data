  * **No armor penalty:** Doesn't affect the Mage's spellcasting abilities
  * **Default equipment:** Given to players starting as Mage

==== Class Armor Ability ====
The Mage's Class Armor special ability is **[[rpd:body_armor_spell|Body Armor]]** which:
  * Temporarily increases armor significantly
  * Reduces movement speed during effect
  * Uses mana instead of HP to cast
  * Cooldown of 20 turns

==== Advancement ====
  * The Mage's class armor ability is Body Armor spell
