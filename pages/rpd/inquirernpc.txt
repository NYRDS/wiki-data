The **Inquirer NPC** is a non-player character in Remixed Dungeon that appears to be related to survey functionality in the game. The NPC was likely designed to provide survey opportunities to players, potentially for feedback or user experience data collection.

==== Description ====
The Inquirer NPC was implemented as a survey interface for players. Based on the code implementation, it was designed to interact with players by presenting options for surveys and privacy policies.

==== Mechanics ====
The NPC was intended to have the following functionality:
  * Present survey opportunities to players
  * Provide privacy policy information
  * Show different UI options based on internet connectivity
  * Present a dialog with survey, privacy policy, and decline options

==== Code Implementation ====
Based on the implementation in [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/nyrds/pixeldungeon/mobs/npc/InquirerNPC.java|InquirerNPC.java]]:
  * Inherits from ImmortalNPC class
  * Contains commented-out survey functionality (likely due to deprecation or privacy concerns)
  * Includes methods for consent checking and survey presentation
  * Has dialog options for accepting surveys, viewing privacy policy, or declining

  * Information source: Java class [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/nyrds/pixeldungeon/mobs/npc/InquirerNPC.java|InquirerNPC.java]]
