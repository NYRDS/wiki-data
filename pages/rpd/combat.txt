{{ rpd:images:combat_example.png|Combat Example }}

**Combat** is the system for resolving conflicts between characters (hero and enemies) in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Basic Combat Mechanics ====
  * **Turn-based**: Combat happens in turns, with each actor taking actions sequentially
  * **Initiative**: Determined by character speed and status effects
  * **Attack Roll**: Calculated using attacker's skill vs defender's defense skill
  * **Damage**: Calculated based on weapon damage or spell power minus defense

==== Attack Mechanics ====
  * **Attack Skill**: Determines the chance to hit an enemy
  * **Defense Skill**: Determines the chance to avoid being hit
  * **Hit Chance**: Based on the formula involving both attack and defense skills
  * **Critical Hits**: Occur with a certain probability for extra damage

==== Damage Calculation ====
  * **Weapon Damage**: Varies randomly within a range for each weapon
  * **Defense**: Reduces incoming damage by a certain amount (DR - Defense Rate)
  * **Elemental Effects**: Fire, cold, poison, and other elements may modify damage
  * **Status Effects**: Buffs/debuffs may affect damage output or resistance

==== Combat Types ====
  * **[[rpd:melee_combat|Melee Combat]]**: Close-range fighting with weapons
  * **[[rpd:ranged_combat|Ranged Combat]]**: Attacking from a distance with bows, throwing weapons, or spells
  * **Spell Combat**: Using magical abilities to attack enemies

==== Combat Actions ====
  * **Attack**: Basic melee or ranged attack
  * **Special Abilities**: Class-specific combat techniques
  * **Item Use**: Consuming potions, scrolls, or other items during combat
  * **Movement**: Positioning for tactical advantage

==== Combat Strategy ====
  * **Positioning**: Controlling distance and movement to optimize combat
  * **Equipment**: Using appropriate weapons and armor for each situation
  * **Resources**: Managing health, mana, and consumables effectively
  * **Enemy Knowledge**: Understanding enemy weaknesses and abilities
