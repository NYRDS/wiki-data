====== Freezing ======

The **Freezing** status effect is a temporary condition that affects characters in the dungeon. When frozen, a character becomes immobilized and unable to take actions until the effect wears off or is removed.

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Duration**: The freezing effect typically lasts for a certain number of turns based on the source of the effect
  * **Immobilization**: While frozen, the affected character cannot move or take any actions
  * **Stacking**: Usually does not stack with similar immobilizing effects like paralysis or stunning
  * **Damage Interaction**: Taking damage will break the freezing effect (as implemented in the Frost buff)

==== Sources of Freezing ====
  * [[rpd:frost|Frost]]-based attacks
  * [[rpd:wand_of_frost|Wand of Frost]]
  * [[rpd:potion_of_frost|Potion of Frost]]
  * [[rpd:icecap|Icecap]] plant
  * [[rpd:water_elemental|Water Elemental]] attacks
  * [[rpd:cold_spirit|Cold Spirit]] attacks
  * Some enemy abilities

==== Countering Freezing ====
  * Waiting for the effect to naturally expire
  * Taking damage (breaks the effect)
  * Using items that clear status effects
  * Applying fire-based damage does not break freezing (fire immunity is separate)

  * [[rpd:iceelemental|Ice Elemental]] - Enemies that can apply freezing
  * [[rpd:ice_guardian|Ice Guardian]] - Enemies that use freezing attacks
  * [[rpd:paralysis|Paralysis]] - Similar immobilizing effect
  * [[rpd:stun|Stun]] - Another temporary immobilization effect
