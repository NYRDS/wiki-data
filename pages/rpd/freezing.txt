====== Freezing ======

==== Description ====
Freezing is a blob effect in Remixed Dungeon that applies the frozen status to creatures that come into contact with it. Freezing is created by the Potion of Frost when it shatters.

==== Effect ====
When creatures come into contact with the freezing blob:
  * **Freezing Effect:** Creatures become frozen in place, unable to move or act
  * **Duration:** Creatures remain frozen until the effect wears off or is cleared
  * **Area of Effect:** Affects all creatures that enter the frozen area

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Activation:** Freezing is created when a [[rpd:potion_of_frost_item|Potion of Frost]] shatters
  * **Radius:** The freezing effect covers a 2-tile radius around the impact point
  * **Persistence:** The freezing blob remains for a short time, continuing to freeze creatures
  * **Duration:** The blob dissipates after a few turns

==== Interaction ====
  * **Movement:** Frozen creatures cannot move or take action
  * **Damage:** Some fire-based attacks can clear freezing effects
  * **Duration:** The freeze effect wears off naturally after some time
  * **Immunities:** Some creatures are naturally immune to the freezing effect

==== Strategy ====
  * Use in combat to temporarily disable dangerous enemies
  * Effective for crowd control when facing multiple enemies
  * Be careful not to freeze yourself or important allies
  * Works well in narrow corridors where enemies are forced to move through the area
