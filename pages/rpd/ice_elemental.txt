====== Ice Elemental ======

{{ rpd:images:iceelemental_sprite.png|Ice Elemental }}

Ice Elementals are magical creatures that inhabit the Ice Caves. They are among the most dangerous elementals in the dungeon due to their ability to slow down enemies with their chilling presence. While they can hardly be considered powerful in terms of raw stats, they can truly be called one of the most dangerous ones. The frost aura that emits from their bodies can slow down any enemy.

  * **Immunities**: Immune to [[rpd:roots|Roots]], [[rpd:paralysis|Paralysis]], [[rpd:stun|Stun]], and [[rpd:toxic_gas|Toxic Gas]]
  * **Depth Scaling**: All stats scale based on current dungeon depth

==== Habitat ====
Ice Elementals can be found in the [[rpd:ice_caves|Ice Caves]] levels (ice1-ice4).

==== Drops ====
  * [[rpd:frozen_carpaccio|Frozen Carpaccio]] with a 10% chance (0.1f)

==== Strategy ====
  * Be prepared for potential slow effects that can hinder your movement and attack speed
  * Since they have low damage output, they're generally manageable in combat
  * The slow effect can be particularly dangerous when fighting multiple enemies
  * Consider using ranged weapons to avoid trigger the slow chance on adjacent attacks
  * Ice Elementals can be dangerous due to their ability to slow you
  * They become stronger in deeper levels of the dungeon
  * Their slow effect can make escaping difficult
  * Attack from range if possible to avoid the slowing effect
