====== Sheep ======

{{ rpd:images:sheep_sprite.png|Sheep Sprite }}

Sheep are temporary mobs created by the [[rpd:wand_of_flock|Wand of Flock]]. They appear as woolly creatures and make "baa" sounds when interacted with.

==== Behavior ====
  * **Temporary**: Sheep have a limited lifespan and will disappear after a certain time
  * **Passive**: Do not attack or engage in combat
  * **Interactable**: When talked to, they make random "baa" sounds
  * **Fragile**: Cannot take damage (damage() method does nothing)

==== Technical Details ====
  * **Java Class**: [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/watabou/pixeldungeon/items/wands/WandOfFlock.java#L90|WandOfFlock.Sheep]]
  * **Inherits From**: [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/watabou/pixeldungeon/actors/mobs/npcs/NPC.java|NPC]]
  * **Sprite Configuration**: Uses spritesDesc/Sheep.json for appearance

==== Strategy ====
  * Sheep are harmless and serve primarily as a visual effect from the [[rpd:wand_of_flock|Wand of Flock]]
  * They can block passages temporarily during combat situations
