==== Description ====
The **Potion of Healing** is a common consumable item that restores a portion of the drinker's health instantly. It's one of the most essential items for survival in the dungeon.

==== Effects ====
* **Health Restoration:** Restores approximately 50% of maximum HP
* **Additional Effect:** May provide temporary healing over time depending on the character's traits

==== Availability ====
* **Dropped by:** Various enemies, particularly healers and creatures with regenerative abilities
* **Found in:** Chests, shops, and special rooms throughout the dungeon
* **Alchemy:** Can be brewed using Sungrass and other healing plants

==== Strategy ====
* Keep at least 1-2 potions for emergency situations
* Consume before facing challenging enemies or bosses
* More valuable in deeper dungeon levels where healing resources become scarce
* Consider saving for critical moments rather than minor damage

==== Notes ====
* Does not restore full health, so additional healing methods may be needed
* The healing effect may vary depending on the character's class and equipment
* Essential for long dungeon runs where other healing options are limited
