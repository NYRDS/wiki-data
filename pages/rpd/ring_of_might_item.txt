==== Status ====
**This item was removed from the game in a previous update.** The information below represents the item as it existed in earlier versions.

==== Description ====
The Ring of Might incrementally increased the wearer's effective strength, allowing them to wear heavier armor and weapons. This was particularly useful for characters who had reached their natural strength limit but still needed to equip powerful items that required more strength.

==== Effects ====
  * **Strength Bonus:** Provided a gradual increase to effective strength
  * **Rate of Growth:** Strength bonus increased slowly over time
  * **Cap:** Bonus was capped at a maximum amount (usually +3 to +4 strength)
  * **Permanent While Equipped:** Bonus remained as long as the ring was worn

==== Stats ====
  * **Effect Type:** Passive strength enhancement
  * **Upgradeable:** Could be upgraded with scrolls of upgrade
  * **Degradation:** Quality may have decreased over time (with some variants)
  * **Rarity:** Rare (appeared less frequently than other rings)

==== Strategy ====
  * **Early Game:** May not have provided immediate benefit if strength requirement was already met
  * **Mid Game:** Useful for wearing armor/weapon upgrades that had high strength requirements
  * **Late Game:** Essential for using the most powerful equipment with high strength requirements
  * **Pairing:** Worked well with other rings of utility

==== Acquisition ====
  * **Random Drops:** Found as random drops from mobs
  * **Chests:** May have appeared in various chests throughout the dungeon
  * **NPCs:** Sometimes sold by shopkeepers or other NPCs
  * **Upgrading:** Could be improved with scrolls of upgrade
