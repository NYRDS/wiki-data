====== Goo (Mob) ======

{{ rpd:images:goo_sprite.png|Goo Sprite }}

Goo (The Black Blob) is a massive living sludge that inhabits the sewers of the dungeon. It has grown to large proportions by consuming waste and detritus in the sewers, and has become highly dangerous. It's the boss of the Sewers area.

  * **Screen Shake**: Causes screen shake when attacking in pumped up state
  * **Toxic Gas Resistance**: Immune to [[rpd:toxic_gas|Toxic Gas]]
  * **Pump-Up Delay**: Takes 2.2 turns to pump up, giving players a window to attack before increased damage

==== Combat Mechanics ====
  * **Pumping**: Goo can pump itself up which increases damage (4-11 → 7-21), attack skill (11 → 26), and range (melee → 2 tiles)
  * **Water Interaction**: Goo regenerates 1 HP when standing in water while below full health
  * **Ooze Effect**: Goo's attacks have a 33% chance to inflict Ooze, causing continuous damage until washed off
  * **Arena**: Takes place in a specially designed arena with water features
  * **Pump Reset**: Goo's pumped state is reset after each attack, returning to normal stats
  * **Zap Immunity**: When zapped (by wands/scrolls), Goo's pumped state is reset

==== Location ====
  * Found in the Sewers area (level 5)
  * Appears in a boss arena specially designed with water features

==== Preparation ====
  * **Equipment**: Ranged weapons preferred to avoid close combat
  * **Consumables**: Bring healing items and utility scrolls
  * **Strategy**: Understand puddle mechanics for positioning
  * **Footwear**: Avoid getting stuck in puddles
  * **Water awareness**: Be mindful that Goo heals in water

==== Strategy ====
  * Stay out of water tiles where Goo can heal
  * Use ranged attacks to maintain distance
  * Dodge the pumping attack by moving along the edges
  * Attack during safe windows after the pumping attack
  * Don't let the fight go on too long as Goo becomes more aggressive when pumped up
  * Avoid getting hit by Goo when it's pumped up as it does more damage and has increased range
  * Clean off Ooze status effect when inflicted to prevent continuous damage
  * Exploit the 2.2 turn pump-up delay to attack safely before Goo becomes more dangerous
  * Attack right after Goo uses its pumped up attack, as it will reset to normal stats

==== Drops ====
  * [[rpd:skeleton_key|Skeleton Key]] for the Demon Halls
  * High chance (80%) to drop a random [[rpd:potion|Potion]]
  * Access to the next dungeon area (Prison)
  * Valuable treasure and experience
  * Unlock for [[rpd:mage|Mage]] class upon defeating as any class

==== Description ====
Little is known about The Goo. It's quite possible that it is not even a creature, but rather a conglomerate of substances from the sewers that gained rudiments of free will. Either way, it's obvious dark magic is at work here.

==== Notes ====
The Goo boss is found in the sewers area of the dungeon. Defeating it often results in acid pools that can damage the player, making positioning crucial during the battle. Goo has a unique "pump up" mechanic that makes it significantly more dangerous after it performs a special action that increases its stats temporarily.
