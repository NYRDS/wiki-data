  * **Movement:** Affected characters attempt to run away from enemies they can see
  * **Duration:** The effect lasts until it wears off or is cured
  * **Behavior:** Affected characters generally avoid engaging in combat while terrified

==== Causes ====
Terror can be inflicted by:

  * Special abilities of certain mobs
  * Some curses or dark magic effects
  * Certain wands with fear effects may cause terror in some game variants

==== Counters ====
  * [[rpd:resistances|Fear Resistance]] may prevent the effect
