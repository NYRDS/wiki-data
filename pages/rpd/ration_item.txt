The **Ration** (also known as Ration of Food) is the standard food item in Remixed Dungeon. All classes start with one ration in their inventory, except for the Gnoll which starts with no armor and special food items.

A preserved piece of food that restores 5000 hunger points over time. It's the standard food provided to heroes at the start of their journey.

  * **Hunger Restoration**: Restores 5000 hunger points over time
  * **Satiety**: Provides a moderate amount of food satisfaction
  * **Nutrition**: Standard nutritional value for maintaining hero health
