Spider Exploding is a special type of spider mob in Remixed Dungeon that explodes with a random plant effect when attacking.

==== Description ====
Spider Exploding is a spider variant that explodes when it successfully attacks an enemy. The explosion applies a random plant effect to the target based on the spider's internal kind.

==== Stats ====
  * **HP:** 5
  * **Min Damage:** 3
  * **Max Damage:** 6
  * **Defense:** 1
  * **Attack:** 125
  * **Speed:** 2x
  * **EXP:** 3
  * **Max Level:** 9
  * **Dr:** 0
  * **CarcassChance:** 0 (does not leave a corpse when defeated)

==== Special Abilities ====
  * **Explosion on Attack:** When attacking successfully, the spider dies and applies a random plant effect to the target
  * **Plant Effects:** The plant effect is randomly selected from: Firebloom, Icecap, Sorrowmoss, Dreamweed, Sungrass, Earthroot, Fadeleaf, Moongrace
  * **No Corpses:** These spiders do not leave behind corpses when killed

==== Behavior ====
  * These spiders will attack enemies like regular spiders
  * Unlike other spiders, they have a very high attack skill (125)
  * When they successfully hit an enemy, they explode with their plant effect and die
  * The plant effect applied is determined by the spider's kind (0-7), corresponding to different plant types

==== Strategy ====
  * These spiders are particularly dangerous as they can apply negative status effects on attack
  * The high attack skill means they are likely to succeed in their attacks
  * Defeating them requires good timing or defensive strategies
  * The explosion happens immediately upon a successful attack, so damage prevention may not help
  * Consider the risk vs. reward when engaging these enemies
