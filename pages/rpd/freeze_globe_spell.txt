====== Freeze Globe ======

**Freeze Globe** is an advanced spell in Remixed Pixel Dungeon that targets a single cell to freeze the character standing there. It's an elemental magic spell that inflicts both Frost and Slow status effects.

==== Description ====
Freeze Globe creates a globe of freezing energy that targets a single cell. If an enemy or other character is on that cell, they will be affected by both Frost (freezing them in place) and Slow (reducing their speed).

==== Stats ====
  * **Magic Affinity**: Elemental
  * **Level**: 3 (Advanced)
  * **Spell Cost**: 4 mana
  * **Targeting**: Single cell
  * **Effects**: Frost (freezes target) and Slow (reduces speed)

==== Mechanics ====
When cast on an occupied cell, Freeze Globe will:
  * Apply Frost buff (prevents action and movement) for a duration based on target's stats
  * Apply Slow buff (reduces movement speed) for a duration based on target's stats
  * Create visual effects (snow particles and blue burst)
  * Play shattering sound effect

==== Usage ====
This spell is particularly useful for:
  * Stopping aggressive enemies temporarily
  * Creating breathing room during difficult encounters
  * Setting up opportunities for attacks
  * Preventing dangerous enemies from acting or moving
  * Combining with other attacks when the target is frozen in place

==== Classes ====

Freeze Globe is most effective when used to control individual enemies, allowing for more strategic combat. Since it targets a single cell and affects whatever is there, careful positioning is crucial.
