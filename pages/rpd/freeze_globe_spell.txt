====== Freeze Globe ======

**Freeze Globe** is an advanced spell in Remixed Pixel Dungeon that targets a single cell to freeze the character standing there. It's an elemental magic spell that inflicts both Frost and Slow status effects.

==== Description ====
Freeze Globe creates a globe of freezing energy that targets a single cell. If an enemy or other character is on that cell, they will be affected by both Frost (freezing them in place) and Slow (reducing their speed and attack rate). According to the string resources, "Freezes the selected character, making it unable to perform any actions for a short period of time." - [[mr:freeze_globe_spell|Code Reference]]
