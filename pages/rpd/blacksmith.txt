====== Blacksmith ======

{{ rpd:images:blacksmith_sprite.png|Blacksmith Sprite }}

The troll blacksmith is a helpful NPC who can upgrade your equipment through his reforge service, but only after you complete his quest.

==== Description ====
This troll blacksmith looks like all trolls look: he is tall and lean, and his skin resembles stone in both color and texture. The troll blacksmith is tinkering with unproportionally small tools.

==== Quest ====
To unlock the blacksmith's services, you must complete one of two possible quests:

  1. **Dark Gold Quest:** Mine 15 pieces of dark gold ore and bring them to him

  2. **Blood Quest:** Kill a bat with the special pickaxe he provides (making the pickaxe "blood-stained")

==== Services ====
  * **Reforge:** Combines two items of the same type into one of higher quality
    * Costs: Nothing (but requires completing the quest first)
    * Prerequisites: Items must be identified, not cursed, of the same type, and upgradable

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Reforge Requirements:**
    * Both items must be the same type
    * Both items must be identified
    * Neither item can be cursed
    * Items must be of positive or zero level (not junk with negative level)
    * Both must be upgradable items
  * **Reforge Process:**
    * Combines two items into one of higher quality
    * The higher level item determines the base (if levels differ)
    * Provides a free upgrade to the resulting item
    * The lower level item is destroyed in the process

==== Notes ====
  * Found randomly in caves level (depth 12+)
  * Has 1000 defense skill (effectively can't be attacked successfully)
  * After using the reforge service once, will not offer services again (Quest.reforged = true)
  * Only spawns in standard rooms that are 5x5 or larger
  * Alternative quest (blood vs. gold) selected randomly
