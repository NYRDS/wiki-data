==== Strategy ====
* Bees are dangerous due to their poison effect, which can significantly damage your health over time
* Their high speed means they can quickly close distance with you
* Bees are fragile with limited HP, so a single hit from a strong weapon can eliminate them
* Be careful when fighting near beehives, as they will spawn bees when damaged
