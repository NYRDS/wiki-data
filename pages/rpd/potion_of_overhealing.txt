{{ rpd:images:potion_of_overhealing_item.png|Potion of Overhealing }}

The **Potion of Overhealing** is an enhanced healing potion in Remixed Dungeon that provides temporary health over the maximum HP limit.

==== Item Overview ====
  * **Type:** Potion
  * **Rarity:** Rare
  * **Special Effect:** Heals beyond maximum HP with temporary 'shield' health
  * **Usage:** Single use item (consumed upon drinking)
  * **Price:** 50 gold when identified

==== Special Mechanics ====
  * **Overhealing Effect:** Restores health beyond maximum HP up to a temporary 'shield' limit
  * **Temporary Health:** The excess health acts as a buffer that depletes first when taking damage

==== Strategy ====
  * Essential for emergency health restoration during dangerous encounters
  * Best used when expecting significant damage soon after healing
  * Can be used to create a temporary buffer before challenging encounters
  * More valuable than regular healing potions when facing strong enemies
  * Should be conserved for critical moments rather than minor injuries
  * Particularly useful before boss fights or other challenging encounters

==== Obtaining ====
  * Found throughout dungeon levels, typically in later areas
  * Available in shops at higher prices (50 gold when identified)
  * Dropped by certain powerful enemies
  * Found in higher-tier containers and special rooms
  * Can be alchemically crafted from specific ingredients using the alchemy pot

==== Effect ====
When consumed, the Potion of Overhealing restores your current hit points beyond your maximum HP, creating temporary 'shield' health that acts as a buffer against incoming damage.

According to the game's string resources: "An enhanced healing elixir that will instantly heal you to full health and provide additional temporary health that fades over time."
