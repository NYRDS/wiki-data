====== Gnoll ======

The Gnoll is a unique playable class in Remixed Dungeon (known before as Remixed Pixel Dungeon). Gnolls are hyena-like humanoids that dwell in sewers and dungeons. The Gnoll Hero is a special playable class variant.

==== Class Overview ====
  * **Starting Strength:** 15
  * **Starting Health:** 5
  * **Special Ability:** Cannot read or write scrolls and books, but naturally strong
  * **Playstyle:** Melee-focused character with unique limitations

==== Starting Equipment ====
  * **Weapon:** Gnoll Tomahawk - Unlike normal tomahawks, this does not disappear when thrown
  * **Armor:** None (starts without armor)

==== Class Perks ====
  * **15 Strength:** Starts with 15 strength points
  * **5 Health:** Starts with 5 health points (very low)
  * **Cannot Read/Write:** Cannot read or write scrolls and books
  * **Non-Aggressive to Other Gnolls:** Can walk past other gnolls as if they are passive. Using missile weapons on other gnolls, however, will provoke them and cause them to attack normally
  * **Melee Focus:** Damage usually relies on strength because you cannot read scrolls of upgrade

==== Class Advantages ====
  * Very high starting strength (15 points)
  * Unique tomahawk that doesn't disappear when thrown
  * Can passively coexist with other gnolls (until provoked)
  * Strong melee potential

==== Class Disadvantages ====
  * Very low starting health (only 5 points)
  * Cannot read or write scrolls and books
  * Cannot benefit from identification or upgrade scrolls
  * Starts without armor

==== Unlocking Method ====
You can unlock the gnoll character if you befriend a [[rpd:gnoll_brute|Gnoll Brute]] (which can be found on levels 11-14 of Caves location), get it damaged, and make the town priest heal him.

==== Subclasses ====
The Tengu must be defeated to obtain the [[tengu liver]], which can be eaten to gain access to the gnoll subclasses:
  * [[rpd:guardian|Guardian]]
  * [[rpd:witchdoctor|Witchdoctor]]

==== Strategy ====
  * Level up quickly before fighting strong enemies (low starting HP)
  * Focus on melee combat since ranged and magical options are limited
  * Identify items manually since you cannot read identification scrolls
  * Be careful around other gnolls - melee attacks are fine but avoid using ranged attacks
