====== Gnoll ======

Gnoll is a [[playable class]] unique to Remixed Dungeon (known before as Remixed Pixel Dungeon).

• Gnoll cannot read/write, so identifying items is a good idea. Damage usually relies on strength because you cannot read scrolls of upgrade.

• Gnoll can walk past other gnolls as if they are passive. Using missile weapons on other gnolls, however, will provoke them and will cause them to attack you normally.

• Unlike normal tomahawks, [[gnoll tomahawk]] does not disappear when you throw it.

• Gnolls start with a very low health, level up first before fighting a boss.

===== How to unlock Gnoll Class =====

You can unlock the gnoll character if you befriend a [[gnoll brute]] (which can be found on levels 11-14 of Caves location), get it damaged, and make the town priest heal him.

===== Subclasses =====

The tengu must be defeated to obtain the [[tengu liver]], which can be eaten to gain access to the gnoll subclasses:

  * Guardian
  * Witchdoctor
