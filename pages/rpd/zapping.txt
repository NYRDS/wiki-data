====== Zapping ======

Zapping is the action of using wands and other charged items to produce magical effects in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Description ====
Zapping refers to the act of using a wand or other magical implement to direct its power toward a specific target or location. This action consumes charges and produces the wand's specific magical effect.

==== Zapping Mechanics ====
  * **Targeting**: Most zaps require selecting a target or location on the map
  * **Charge Consumption**: Zapping typically consumes one or more charges from the item
  * **Effect Application**: The wand's specific effect is applied to the target
  * **Range**: Most wands have limited range for effective zapping

==== Zapping Considerations ====
  * **Accuracy**: Some wands may miss their intended target
  * **Collateral Effects**: Some zap effects may affect nearby creatures or terrain
  * **Enemy Response**: Using magic may attract attention from nearby enemies
  * **Tactical Positioning**: Effective zapping often requires strategic positioning

==== Zapping Tips ====
  * **Aiming**: Consider splash effects when targeting near allies
  * **Conservation**: Use zaps efficiently, especially when charges are low
  * **Timing**: Zapping during combat should factor in enemy retaliation
  * **Safety**: Avoid zapping when enemies are adjacent when possible
