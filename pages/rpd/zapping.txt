====== Zapping Mechanics ======

**Zapping** refers to the ranged magical attacks performed by certain characters and creatures in Remixed Dungeon, particularly by mages and magic-using mobs.

==== Description ====
Zapping is the term used to describe ranged magical attacks that can be performed by characters with certain abilities. This mechanism allows for ranged attacks without needing physical projectiles like arrows or darts.

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Range:** Typically has a limited range determined by the game's line-of-sight system
  * **Targeting:** Uses the Ballistica system to determine line of sight and range to targets
  * **Accuracy:** Accuracy can be affected by various factors including the attacker's skill and the defender's evasion
  * **Damage:** Damage dealt may vary based on the zapping ability being used

==== Zapping Creatures ====
  * **Warlock:** Uses shadow bolt zapping attacks against enemies, with a 50% chance to apply Weakness
  * **Other magic-using mobs:** Various other spellcasting enemies also use zapping attacks

==== Zapping Ability ====
  * **Ballistica System:** Uses the Ballistica system for line-of-sight calculations to determine if a target is within range
  * **Visual Effects:** Often accompanied by visual effects like magic missiles or sparks
  * **Sound Effects:** May be accompanied by distinctive sound effects when cast

==== Player Zapping ====
  * **Wands:** Players can zap enemies using wands which are a primary form of ranged magical attack
  * **Spells:** Some spells also function as zapping abilities
