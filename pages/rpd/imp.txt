{{ rpd:images:imp_sprite.png|Imp Sprite }}

The **Imp** is an NPC (Non-Player Character) in Remixed Pixel Dungeon that appears in the [[rpd:city|City]] level (depth 16+). The Imp offers a quest that varies between killing either golems or monks.

==== Description ====
Imps are lesser demons. They are notable for neither their strength nor their magic talent, but they are quite smart and sociable. Many imps prefer to live among non-demons.

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Type:** NPC (Non-Player Character)
  * **Location:** [[rpd:city|City]] level (depth 17-22)
  * **Spawn Chance:** Random chance (higher at lower city depths)
  * **Spawn Condition:** Dungeon depth > 16 with random chance of (20 - depth)
  * **Quest Type:** Kill quest with 2 possible variations:
    * **Golem Quest:** Kill 6 [[rpd:golem|Golems]] and collect their tokens
    * **Monk Quest:** Kill 8 [[rpd:monk|Monks]] and collect their tokens
  * **Defensive Ability:** Cannot be harmed (1000 defense skill, no damage taken)
  * **Reward:** A specially upgraded ring (level 2, but cursed)

==== Behavior ====
  * Approaches the hero and offers a quest when first seen
  * Reacts differently depending on whether the hero has tokens from required enemies
  * Vanishes after quest completion, saying "See you, [Hero Name]!"
  * If the hero has enough tokens when talking to the Imp, the reward window appears
  * Quest is only active when the Imp has given the quest and it's not completed

==== Quest Mechanics ====
  * **Golem Quest Option:** Alternative quest requiring 6 [[rpd:golem|Golem]] tokens
  * **Monk Quest Option:** Alternative quest requiring 8 [[rpd:monk|Monk]] tokens
  * Each time a targeted enemy is killed during an active Imp quest, a [[rpd:dwarf_token|Dwarf Token]] will drop
  * Reward is a random ring from the level treasury, upgraded to +2 but cursed

==== Strategy ====
  * This quest is generally worth completing as the ring reward is valuable despite being cursed
  * The quest is often easier if you can avoid the required enemy type until you're stronger
  * The cursed ring can be uncursed later with a [[rpd:scroll_of_remove_curse|Scroll of Remove Curse]]
  * Since Imps are unkillable, they're safe to interact with even when low on health
