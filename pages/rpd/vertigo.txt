====== Vertigo ======

Vertigo is a status effect in Remixed Dungeon that disorients the affected character, causing them to move randomly instead of following their intended path.

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Effect:** Affected characters cannot control their movement
  * **Movement:** Characters move in random directions instead of intended path
  * **Duration:** Lasts for a limited number of turns
  * **Action:** Characters can still act (attack, use items) while affected

==== Strategy ====
  * **For Players:** Use vertigo strategically against enemies to limit their movement
  * **For Defense:** Be aware that vertigo can make escaping difficult
  * **Combat:** Vertigo can separate enemies from groups or dangerous positions
  * **Movement:** When affected, try to position yourself safely before the effect ends

==== Countering Vertigo ====
