====== vertigo ======

Vertigo is a status effect in Remixed Dungeon that disorients the affected character, causing them to move randomly instead of following their intended path.

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Effect:** Affected characters cannot control their movement
  * **Movement:** Characters move in random directions instead of intended path
  * **Duration:** Default duration is 10 turns (modified by Ring of Elements resistance)
  * **Action:** Characters can still act (attack, use items) while affected
  * **Message:** "Everything is spinning around you!" when hero is affected
