Wraiths are incorporeal undead creatures that are more difficult to hit in combat. They are among the more dangerous undead enemies in the dungeon.

A wraith is a dangerous undead creature, formed from the spirit of someone who died violently or with unfinished business.

  * **Flight:** Always flying, can pass over obstacles and through walls
  * **Spawns:** With increasing frequency in deeper dungeon levels

Wraiths can be found in:
  * Deeper dungeon levels where stronger undead dwell
  * [[rpd:halls|Halls]] of the dungeon
  * [[rpd:caves|Caves]] levels
  * Areas with other powerful undead creatures

==== Tactics ====
  * Use area-of-effect attacks to increase hit chance
  * Items or abilities that reduce evasion may be helpful

  * Fire or holy damage typically effective against undead
  * Consider using debuffs that reduce accuracy or cause blindness on your enemies
  * Note: Killing them provides no experience points
