Wraiths are incorporeal undead creatures that are more difficult to hit in combat. They are among the more dangerous undead enemies in the dungeon.

==== Description ====
Wraiths are ghostly undead with a translucent appearance. They are particularly difficult to hit in combat and can pass through certain obstacles that block other creatures.

==== Combat ====
  * **Evasion:** Very difficult to hit (high dodge chance)
  * **Attack:** Ethereal melee attacks that may have special properties
  * **Abilities:** May be able to pass through walls or barriers
  * **Immunities:** Standard undead immunities plus possible additional resistances

==== Characteristics ====
  * **Incorporeal:** May have the ability to phase or pass through obstacles
  * **Hard to Hit:** Significantly higher evasion than most creatures
  * **Undead Traits:** Immune to poison, bleeding, and other living-targeted effects

==== Location ====
Wraiths can be found in:
  * Deeper dungeon levels where stronger undead dwell
  * [[rpd:halls|Halls]] of the dungeon
  * [[rpd:caves|Caves]] levels
  * Areas with other powerful undead creatures

==== Tactics ====
  * Use area-of-effect attacks to increase hit chance
  * Items or abilities that reduce evasion may be helpful
  * Ranged attacks might be more effective than melee
  * Fire or holy damage typically effective against undead
  * Consider using debuffs that reduce accuracy or cause blindness on your enemies
