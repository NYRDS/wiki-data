==== Description ====
The **Shaman Elder** is a special variant of the Gnoll Shaman mob found in the dungeon. This particular gnoll looks much older than other shamans and surely has a higher status in the tribe. A strange aura slowly forms around him, which seems to reflect all that touches it.

==== Stats ====
  * **Level**: Appears in levels 13-14 (very rare in level 13, more common in level 14)
  * **Behavior**: Uses ranged attacks and has special abilities
  * **Special Ability**: When damaged, may activate a Mana Shield buff

==== Behavior ====
  * When enemy is within 1-2 tiles, the Shaman Elder will flee
  * When enemy is more than 4 tiles away, it will hunt them down
  * When damaged, may activate a Mana Shield for protection
