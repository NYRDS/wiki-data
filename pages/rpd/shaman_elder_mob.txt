====== Elder Shaman ======

{{ rpd:images:mob_ShamanElder.png|Elder Shaman }}

**Elder Shaman** is a mob in Remixed Dungeon that appears primarily in the later levels of the dungeon.

==== Description ====
This particular gnoll looks much older than other shamans and surely has a higher status in the tribe. A strange aura slowly forms around him, which seems to reflect all that touches it. Elder Shamans are particularly dangerous enemies with unique abilities.

  * **Health Points:** 48 HP
  * **Attack Skill:** 20
  * **Defense Skill:** 14
  * **Damage:** 8-12
  * **Defense Rating:** 4
  * **Attack Delay:** 1 turn
  * **Attack Range:** 6 tiles
  * **View Distance:** 6 tiles
  * **Speed:** Normal (1.0x)
  * **Experience Value:** 9 EXP
  * **Maximum Level:** 16

==== Drops ====
  * **Loot:** SpellBook (100% chance)

==== Level Generation ====
  * Appears in levels 13 and 14 based on the Bestiary configuration
  * Low spawn rate (0.01 in level 13, 0.1 in level 14)

==== Behavior ====
  * Uses ranged attacks from distance
  * Has a reflective aura ability
  * Can be tamed (canBePet: true)
  * Not a flying creature
  * Hostile to the player

==== Strategy ====
  * Approach carefully due to its ranged attacks and reflective abilities
  * Consider using area-of-effect spells or abilities as they might be reflected
  * The high experience value makes it a valuable target for level grinding
  * Since it can be tamed, consider methods for pet taming if desired

==== Notes ====
  * This mob can potentially be tamed as a pet (canBePet: true)
  * The reflective aura might make direct damage spells less effective
