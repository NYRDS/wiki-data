====== Albino Rat ======

{{ rpd:images:albino_rat_mob.png|Albino Rat }}

The **Albino Rat** is a rare variant of the common [[rpd:rat_mob|Marsupial Rat]] found in the Sewers (levels 1-4) of Remixed Dungeon. These pale, aggressive rats are more dangerous than their common counterparts and have special abilities that set them apart.

==== Overview ====
Albino rats are much rarer variants of the common Marsupial Rat. While still relatively weak individually, they possess a special ability that can make them significantly more dangerous than normal rats - they cause bleeding damage to their target when attacking.

==== Stats ====
  * **HP**: 8 (HT: 8)
  * **Defense Skill**: 3
  * **Attack Skill**: 8
  * **Damage**: 1-6 (1-5 physical damage + 1-1 additional bleed damage)
  * **Armor**: 1 DR (Defense Rating)
  * **EXP for Kill**: 1 (varies with level)
  * **Maximum Level**: 7
  * **Level Range**: Found in Sewers (levels 2-4, primarily level 3 with special density)

==== Abilities ====
  * **Bleeding Attack**: When the Albino Rat successfully hits the player, it inflicts additional bleed damage
  * **Aggressive Behavior**: Like common rats, they are aggressive but weak individually
  * **Rarity**: Much less common than regular rats (0.03 density on level 3 only)

==== Combat Tactics ====
Albino rats follow the same simple AI patterns as regular rats, moving toward the player and attacking when adjacent. However, their bleeding attack makes them more threatening than normal rats, especially if multiple hits occur in succession.

==== Occurrence ====
  * **Primary Location**: Sewers level 3 (rare, density 0.03)
  * **Spawn Frequency**: Very rare compared to common rats
  * **Group Behavior**: Usually found alone or in very small groups
  * **Variant Type**: Albino rats are the bleedy variant of the common rat

==== Strategy ====
  * Defeating them quickly is important to avoid sustained bleeding damage
  * Consider using armor or other damage reduction to minimize the bleeding effect
  * Avoid being surrounded by multiple albino rats as the bleeding damage stacks
  * Use ranged weapons or spells to pick them off from a safe distance
  * Prioritize healing if engaged in combat with multiple albino rats

==== Special Notes ====
  * Like normal rats, their death can trigger quest checks for multiple NPCs
  * The bleeding effect can stack if multiple albino rats hit repeatedly
  * Despite being rare, they're still early-game enemies suitable for low-level characters
  * They follow the same basic AI as common rats but with the added danger of bleed damage
