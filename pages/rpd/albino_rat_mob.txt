==== Description ====
Albino Rats are rare white variants of the common dungeon rat. They appear in the Sewers and behave similarly to regular rats but with a special attack mechanic. According to the game description: "Marsupial rats are aggressive, but rather weak denizens of the sewers. They can be dangerous only in big numbers. This particular rat seems to be an albino. It also has abnormally sharp teeth."

==== Behavior ====
  * Similar to regular rats - moves directly toward the player
  * Has a special attack that causes bleeding damage to the target
  * Generally appears alone rather than in groups
  * The attack has a 50% chance of causing a Bleeding effect on the target equal to the damage dealt

==== Special Ability ====
  * **Bleeding Attack**: On successful hit, there is a 50% chance to cause Bleeding status effect on the target equal to the damage dealt

==== Drops ====
Albino Rats typically drop:
  * Small amount of gold
  * Standard rat drop items

==== Habitat ====
  * Spawn rate: Very rare (0.03 weight in Bestiary.json for level 3)
  * Found primarily in Sewer level (level 3)
  * Part of the rare spawns in the dungeon

==== Strategy ====
  * While individually weak, be aware of the bleeding effect which can accumulate over time
  * Potentially more dangerous than regular rats due to the bleeding effect
  * Try to avoid getting surrounded by multiple Albino Rats to prevent stacking bleeding damage
