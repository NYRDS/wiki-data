{{ albino_rat_mob.png|Albino Rat }}

The **Albino Rat** is a rare variant of the regular Marsupial Rat found in the Sewers area of Remixed Dungeon. They have abnormally sharp teeth and distinctive white coloration.

==== Overview ====
The Albino Rat is a rare white variant of the common dungeon rat. They appear in the Sewers and behave similarly to regular rats but possess a special bleeding attack. They are described as: "Marsupial rats are aggressive, but rather weak denizens of the sewers. They can be dangerous only in big numbers. This particular rat seems to be an albino. It also has abnormally sharp teeth."

==== Stats ====
  * **HP**: 15 (HT: 15) - Fixed higher value than regular rats (8)
  * **Defense Skill**: 3 (inherited from Rat)
  * **Attack Skill**: 8 (inherited from Rat)
  * **Damage**: 1-5 (inherited from Rat)
  * **Armor**: 1 DR (inherited from Rat)
  * **EXP for Kill**: 1 (inherited from Rat)
  * **Maximum Level**: 7 (inherited from Rat)

==== Abilities ====
  * **Bleeding Attack**: On successful hit, has a 50% chance to cause Bleeding status effect on the target equal to the damage dealt
  * **Inheritance**: Inherits all other abilities from the Marsupial Rat (fleeing behavior when affected by Giant Rat Skull, quest trigger on death)

==== Combat Tactics ====
Albino rats behave like regular rats but add a dangerous bleeding effect to their attacks. They will approach the player and attack normally, but with a significant chance to apply a dangerous status effect.

==== Occurrence ====
  * **Primary Location**: Sewers level (level 3)
  * **Spawn Frequency**: Very rare (0.03 density on level 3 according to Bestiary.json)
  * **Group Behavior**: Usually found alone
  * **Special Variants**: No special variants

==== Strategy ====
  * Be aware of the bleeding effect which can accumulate over time, especially in dangerous situations
  * While individually weak like regular rats, the bleeding effect makes them more dangerous
  * Prioritize eliminating them over regular rats if multiple rats are present
  * Use armor or other defenses that can reduce the damage that gets converted to bleeding
  * Healing or bleed removal items can be crucial when fighting multiple albino rats
  * The bleeding effect can be especially dangerous if combined with other damage sources

==== Special Notes ====
  * The albino rat inherits all properties from the regular rat, including quest triggers on death
  * Killing an albino rat contributes to the RARE_ALBINO badge
  * The 50% chance to apply bleeding based on the damage dealt can result in significant ongoing damage
  * They are the only common enemy that can apply the bleeding effect without special conditions
  * Still affected by the Giant Rat Skull artifact like regular rats
