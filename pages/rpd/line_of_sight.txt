====== Line of Sight ======

**Line of Sight** is a fundamental game mechanic that determines what areas and entities the hero can see and interact with.

==== Basic Concept ====
  * Line of sight determines which tiles are visible to the hero
  * The hero can typically see in a circular radius around their position
  * Walls and other solid obstacles block line of sight
  * Some effects can extend or restrict the hero's line of sight

==== Applications ====
  * **Movement**: The hero can only move to adjacent visible tiles
  * **Ranged Attacks**: Ranged weapons require an unobstructed line of sight to the target
  * **Spells**: Many spells require line of sight to affect targets
  * **Detection**: Enemies and items are only visible when in line of sight

==== Mechanics ====
  * Light sources can affect line of sight in dark areas
  * Some abilities or items can grant extended vision
  * Darkness or fog effects can reduce line of sight
  * Certain terrain features may block or redirect line of sight
