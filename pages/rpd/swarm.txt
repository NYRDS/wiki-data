====== Swarm Mob ======

{{ rpd:images:swarm_sprite.png|Swarm Mob }}

==== Description ====
A **Swarm** is a cluster of bats that act as a single mob. It's a flying creature with low individual damage but high hit points and the ability to split when damaged.

==== Stats ====
  * **HP**: 80
  * **Attack Skill**: 12
  * **Defense Skill**: 5
  * **Damage**: 1-4
  * **Level**: Up to level 10
  * **Max Level**: 10
  * **EXP**: Not specified (likely 0 like other low-level mobs)

==== Properties ====
  * **Flying**: Swarms can fly over obstacles
  * **Splitting**: When taking damage and having sufficient HP (at least damage + 2), the Swarm will split into two separate Swarms
  * **Loot**: Drops [[rpd:potion_of_healing|Potion of Healing]] with 0.2f basic chance, reduced by generation level (chance / (generation + 1f))

==== Behavior ====
  * When attacked and has enough health (HP >= damage + 2), a Swarm will split into two Swarms
  * Each new Swarm has reduced health relative to the original
  * Each new Swarm has reduced loot drop chance based on its generation level
  * Multiple generations can exist from a single original Swarm
  * As flying creatures, they're unaffected by terrain features like chasms or webbing

==== Strategy ====
  * Area-of-effect attacks can damage multiple Swarm entities at once
  * Be careful with high-damage attacks as they can cause a Swarm to split into multiple enemies
  * Consider using low-damage attacks to avoid splitting
  * Swarms are particularly dangerous in groups due to their multiplication ability
