The **Librarian** is an NPC that appears in the Library special room in the dungeon. He provides information about all sorts of things that can be found in the dungeon, specifically knowledge that has been discovered by adventurers.

==== Encounter ====
The Librarian appears in Library rooms which are special rooms that may appear on any dungeon level. When an adventurer visits the library, they can interact with the Librarian to access information about game entities they have encountered.

==== Mechanics ====
The Librarian helps players access the Library interface, which contains information about:
* Items discovered by the player
* Mobs encountered by the player
* Codex entries
* Level information

Each time a player visits the library, there may be new information to read if they have encountered new entities in the dungeon.

==== Dialogue ====
When interacted with, the Librarian says:
"H-hello. Welcome to the Library. Here you can find the information about all sort of things, that can be found in the dungeon... actually we can only provide knowledge that was discovered by adventurers. It... it's kind of embarrassing. So each time you visit us, probably, there will be new things to read."

==== Location ====
Library special rooms that appear randomly on dungeon levels (not guaranteed to appear on every level).
