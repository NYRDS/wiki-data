==== Description ====
Skeletons are reanimated bones of deceased adventurers and dungeon dwellers. They are commonly found in the sewers and prison levels. They carry weapons and armor from their previous life but have limited intelligence.

==== Behavior ====
  * Skeletons are aggressive and will pursue the player when detected
  * They are immune to many status effects due to being undead
  * They can take reduced damage from certain attacks due to their skeletal nature

==== Drops ====
Skeletons may drop:
  * [[rpd:gold|Gold]]
  * [[rpd:weapon|Weapons]]
  * [[rpd:armor|Armor]]
  * [[rpd:equip|Equipment]]
  * Occasionally a [[rpd:potions|Potion]] or [[rpd:scrolls|Scroll]]

==== Strategy ====
  * Use fire-based attacks which are typically effective against undead
  * Mind-blast attacks (like [[rpd:scroll_of_psionic_blast|Scroll of Psionic Blast]]) may be especially effective
  * Be careful not to get surrounded by multiple skeletons in narrow passages
