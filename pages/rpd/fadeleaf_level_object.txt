====== Fadeleaf Level Object ======

{{ rpd:images:fadeleaf_level_object.png|Fadeleaf Level Object }}

==== Description ====
The Fadeleaf level object provides a teleportation effect when touched. When a character steps on the tile containing a Fadeleaf level object, they are instantly teleported to a random location on the current dungeon level.

==== Effects ====
  * Teleports the character to a random location on the current level
  * Provides an escape mechanism from dangerous situations
  * The destination is random and cannot be controlled
  * The level object disappears after being touched

==== Mechanics ====
  * Fadeleaf level objects can be found growing in the dungeon
  * They can also be grown by planting [[rpd:fadeleaf_seed_item|Fadeleaf Seeds]]
  * The teleportation is to a random valid location on the same level
  * Cannot be used to move to other levels

==== Strategy ====
  * Fadeleaf level objects are useful for escaping dangerous situations
  * Can be used to quickly navigate the level, though destination is random
  * Valuable when surrounded by multiple strong enemies
  * Be cautious as the destination is random - you might end up in another dangerous area
