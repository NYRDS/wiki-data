====== Bows and Arrows ======


In Remixed Pixel Dungeon there is a new type of weapons - bows. Any class can use a bow, but only an elf can do damage by firing arrows at close range. Arrows are required in order to use a bow. Bows can also perform melee attacks, but at the cost of effectiveness as the bow attack speed is reduced in melee.

To use the arrows, the player must put them in the slot arms of one of the bows. Damage arrows of envy from the bow. Fire burns any arrows going through. Arrows can be removed in a quiver, which is purchased from a vendor at level 11 for 750 gold. The quiver protects them from burning. The thief and the hunter classes can use the arrows as melee weapons. Arrows can be lubricated by using potions on them.
