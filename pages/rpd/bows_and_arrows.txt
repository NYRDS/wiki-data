====== Bows and Arrows ======

In Remixed Pixel Dungeon there is a new type of weapons - bows. Any class can use a bow, but only an elf can do damage by firing arrows at close range. Arrows are required in order to use a bow. Bows can also perform melee attacks, but they are completely ineffective in close combat for all classes except elves.

==== How Bows Work ====
  * Bows are ranged weapons that require arrows to function
  * When equipped with arrows, bows allow the player to attack enemies at range
  * Only elves can deal significant damage when firing arrows at close range (adjacent squares)
  * Other classes deal very little damage when shooting arrows at close range
  * Bows have specific accuracy and delay factors that affect their performance
  * Bow performance is enhanced by the bow's level and attributes

==== Quiver ====
  * The [[rpd:quiver|Quiver]] is a special bag that can store any amount of arrows
  * It is sold by the shopkeeper in the Town level for 50 gold
  * Unlike what some sources might suggest, the quiver does not specifically protect arrows from burning
  * It simply provides unlimited storage for arrows
