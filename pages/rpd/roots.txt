**Roots** is a negative status effect in Remixed Dungeon that immobilizes the affected character and prevents movement.

==== Effect Description ====
  * **Type:** Negative Status Effect (Debuff)
  * **Effect:** Prevents movement while active
  * **Duration:** Varies by source
  * **Source:** Primarily from enemy attacks or special abilities

==== How to Obtain ====
  * From certain enemy attacks that apply root effects
  * From environmental effects in specific dungeon areas
  * From some enemy abilities that restrict movement

==== Mechanics ====
  * Prevents all movement while the effect is active
  * Character can still perform other actions (attacking, using items, etc.)
  * Can be detached by the Levitation status effect (which is why Levitation mentions it)
  * Does not prevent other actions beyond movement
  * Duration typically decreases with higher Magic Defense

==== Strategy ====
  * Be cautious when entering areas with plant-based enemies that may apply roots
  * If you're about to be rooted, try to position yourself advantageously before the effect ends
  * Carry Levitation potions if regularly encountering enemies that use roots
  * Can be dangerous if applied near other enemies or hazards
  * Useful in limited situations where you want to stay in place for ranged attacks

==== Counters =====
  * [[rpd:levitation|Levitation]] - Completely removes roots when applied
  * High-level armor with good magic defense may resist the effect
  * Some equipment or class abilities may reduce duration
