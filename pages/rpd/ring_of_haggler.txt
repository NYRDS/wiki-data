{{ rpd:images:item_ring_of_haggler.png|Ring of Haggler }}

* **Price Reduction:** At +0: 25% discount, increases with upgrades
* **Effect:** Reduces shop prices by up to 50% at +10

==== Mechanics ====
The ring works by applying a discount multiplier to the base price of items in shops. The higher the ring's level (from [[rpd:scroll_of_upgrade|scroll of upgrade]]), the greater the discount. The discount is applied when the hero is wearing the ring.

==== Strategy ====
* Essential for players who want to maximize their gold efficiency
* Very valuable for purchasing expensive [[rpd:armor|armor]], [[rpd:weapons|weapons]], or [[rpd:potions|potions]]
* Combines with other discount effects multiplicatively
* Particularly useful in the early game when gold is scarce
