==== Behavior ====
* Dwarven Monks perform kick attacks for 50% of their attacks, using a special animation
* They are immune to fear-based status effects like [[rpd:amok|Amok]] and [[rpd:terror|Terror]]
* When disarming a target, the disarmed weapon is dropped on the floor if possible
* When killed, they can trigger the [[rpd:imp|Imp's]] quest in the city level

==== Strategy ====
* Because of their high defense skill and damage resistance, they can be challenging to defeat with low-tier weapons

* Their immunity to fear effects means fear-based tactics won't work against them
* Consider using ranged weapons or magic to avoid the disarm effect
