{{ rpd:images:freerunner_sprite.png|Free Runner }}

The Free Runner is the Rogue's subclass in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Unlocking ====
The Free Runner subclass can be unlocked by using a Tome of Mastery after defeating the second boss (Tengu).

==== Special Mechanics ====
The _Freerunner_ can move almost twice faster, than most of the monsters. When he is running, the Freerunner is much harder to hit. For that he must be unencumbered and not starving.

==== Special Armor ====
Using an Armor Kit on any armor will transform it into the [[rpd:freerunner_armor|Free Runner Armor]], which is specifically designed for this subclass.

==== Advantages ====
  * Significantly faster movement speed
  * Harder to hit when running
  * Excellent for escape and positioning
  * Good for hit-and-run tactics

==== Disadvantages ====
  * Requires being unencumbered (not overburdened)
  * Must not be starving
  * Speed advantage is lost when heavily loaded
  * Requires careful food management
