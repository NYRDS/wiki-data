====== Witchdoctor ======

{{ rpd:images:witchdoctor_sprite.png|Witchdoctor }}

The **Witchdoctor** is a mastery path available for the [[rpd:necromancer|Necromancer]] class in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Unlocking ====
The Witch Doctor subclass can be unlocked by using a [[rpd:tome_of_mastery|Tome of Mastery]] after defeating the second boss (Tengu).

==== Special Mechanics ====
Spellcasting endows the Witchdoctor with a magic shield that completely protects him from incoming damage. This occurs when any spell is cast, providing a temporary shield that blocks all damage for a duration based on the player's skill level.

==== Special Armor ====
Using an [[rpd:armor_kit|Armor Kit]] on any armor will transform it into the [[rpd:witchdoctor_armor|Witch Doctor Armor]], which is specifically designed for this subclass.

==== Advantages ====
  * Magic shield when casting spells that blocks all incoming damage
  * Excellent protection during spellcasting
  * Allows safer casting in dangerous situations
  * Synergizes well with Necromancer's spell focus

==== Disadvantages ====
  * Only activates when casting spells
  * Requires active spell usage to benefit
  * Shield duration tied to spellcasting

==== Strategy ====
  * Use spells strategically to trigger the protective magic shield
  * Plan spell usage around dangerous encounters for maximum protection
  * Since the shield only activates when casting spells, the Witchdoctor should prioritize spell-based items
  * Combine with Necromancer's undead summoning abilities for both protection and offense

==== Class Comparisons ====
  * Similar to the [[rpd:plague_doctor|Plague Doctor]] in combining healing with specialized mechanics, but with magic shielding instead
  * Contrasts with the [[rpd:lich|Lich]] mastery which focuses purely on necromancy
