====== Marsupial Rat Mob ======

{{ rpd:images:rat_mob.png|Marsupial Rat }}

The **Marsupial Rat** is a common enemy found in the Sewers (levels 1-4) of Remixed Dungeon. They are aggressive, but rather weak inhabitants of the sewers. They can be dangerous only in big numbers.

==== Overview ====
Marsupial rats are among the most common enemies found in the early levels of the dungeon. They are aggressive but rather weak denizens of the sewers. While individually harmless, they can become dangerous in large numbers due to their sheer numbers.

==== Stats ====
  * **HP**: 8 (HT: 8)
  * **Defense Skill**: 3
  * **Attack Skill**: 8
  * **Damage**: 1-5
  * **Armor**: 1 DR (Defense Rating)
  * **EXP for Kill**: 1 (varies with level)
  * **Maximum Level**: 7
  * **Level Range**: Found in Sewers (levels 2-4, with higher density on level 3)

==== Abilities ====
  * **Fleeing Behavior**: When the player carries the Giant Rat Skull, rats enter a Fleeing state and avoid attacking
  * **Terror Effect**: If a rat cannot attack due to the Ratter's Aura from the Giant Rat Skull, it will become terrorized (Terror buff) and unable to act
  * **Quest Trigger**: When a rat dies, it triggers quest checks for ScarecrowNPC, Ghost NPC, and Plague Doctor NPC quests
  * **Simple AI**: Basic movement toward the player, attacks when adjacent

==== Combat Tactics ====
Marsupial rats follow simple AI patterns, moving toward the player and attacking when adjacent. They have low stats that make them individually weak, but potentially threatening in groups.

==== Occurrence ====
  * **Primary Location**: Sewers levels (levels 2-4 according to Bestiary.json)
  * **Spawn Frequency**: Very common in Sewers (density: level 2: 1.0, level 3: 1.0, level 4: 1.0)
  * **Group Behavior**: Usually found in small to moderate groups
  * **Special Variants**: Albino rats (rare, 0.03 density on level 3), which have different stats and abilities

==== Strategy ====
  * Individual rats are easy to defeat due to their low stats
  * Be cautious when facing large groups, as their numbers can overwhelm
  * Use ranged weapons or spells to pick them off one-by-one when possible
  * The Giant Rat Skull artifact causes them to flee instead of attacking
  * Their low damage output makes them relatively safe to fight even with low health
  * Focus on eliminating them early before they can surround you

==== Special Notes ====
  * The rat's death triggers quest processing for multiple NPCs (Scarecrow, Ghost, Plague Doctor)
  * When affected by Ratter's Aura, they become frightened and flee; if pursued despite being frightened, they become terrorized
  * Despite their name, they are not actual marsupials but are just called marsupial rats in the game
  * They are the most basic enemy in the game, serving as an introduction to combat mechanics
