==== Description ====
Marsupial rats are aggressive, but rather weak inhabitants of the sewers. They are among the most common enemies found in the early levels of the dungeon. They typically appear in groups of 2-4 individuals.

==== Behavior ====
  * Moves directly toward the player
  * Attacks when adjacent to the player
  * Becomes frightened when the player carries a Giant Rat Skull (Rat-King's Crown aura effect)
  * Will flee from the player when affected by this aura
  * If pursued despite being frightened, will become terrorized and unable to act

==== Special Interactions ====
  * **Rat-King's Crown Aura**: When the player has the Rat-King's Crown aura buff, regular rats will try to flee instead of attacking
  * **Death Effects**: When a rat dies, it triggers quest checks for ScarecrowNPC, Ghost NPC, and Plague Doctor NPC quests
  * **Fleeing Mechanics**: If a rat cannot attack due to the Ratter's Aura, it will enter a Fleeing state

==== Drops ====
Rats typically drop:
  * Small amount of gold
  * Occasionally some food or health potions
  * Rat hide (artifacts:rat_hide_item) - used for crafting

==== Strategy ====
  * Individual rats are easy to defeat
  * Be cautious when facing large groups, as their numbers can overwhelm
  * Use ranged weapons to pick them off one-by-one when possible
  * The rats' low damage output makes them relatively safe to fight with low health
