====== Souls Mechanic ======

**Souls** are a special resource in Remixed Dungeon related to necromancy and the Necromancer class.

==== Description ====
Souls are a resource that can be collected by the Necromancer class through combat. They function as a special currency for casting necromantic spells and abilities.

==== Acquisition ====
  * **Necromancer Class**: The Necromancer automatically collects 1 soul point each time a character dies while they are wearing the Necromancer's Robe
  * **Combat**: Souls are gained primarily through defeating enemies
  * **Special Abilities**: Some necromantic abilities may generate or consume souls

==== Usage ====
  * **Spell Casting**: Necromantic spells consume souls as a casting cost
  * **Pet Summoning**: Some undead pets and abilities require souls to be summoned or activated
  * **Necromantic Abilities**: Various necromancy-related abilities consume souls to function

==== Mechanics ====
  * Souls are a finite resource that must be managed carefully
  * There may be limits on how many souls can be stored at once
  * The Necromancer's Robe is the primary item that enables soul collection

==== Strategy ====
  * Focus on combat to generate more souls for abilities
  * Balance offensive and defensive soul usage
  * Plan ahead for expensive necromantic abilities
  * Manage soul reserves during challenging fights
