**NPC** (Non-Player Character) in Remixed Dungeon refers to friendly characters that are not controlled by the player but have special roles in the game.

==== Description ====
NPCs (Non-Player Characters) are friendly entities that populate the dungeon and provide various services to the player. Unlike regular mobs, they are not hostile and offer services such as trading, information, or quest-related content.

==== Common NPCs ====
  * [[rpd:shopkeeper_npc|Shopkeeper]] - Sells items in shops on various levels
  * [[rpd:wandmaker_npc|Wandmaker]] - Sells high-quality wands in the Prison level
  * [[rpd:blacksmith_npc|Blacksmith]] - Provides upgrading services in the Prison level
  * [[rpd:ghost_npc|Ghost]] - Provides quests and information on deeper levels
  * [[rpd:imp_npc|Imp]] - Eventually provides rewards after completing his quests
  * [[rpd:princess_npc|Princess]] - Appears in the Prison level with specific dialogue

==== Services ====
NPCs provide various services:
  * **Trading**: Selling items and buying from the player
  * **Upgrading**: Enhancing equipment quality
  * **Quests**: Offering and rewarding for completing tasks
  * **Information**: Providing lore and hints about the dungeon
