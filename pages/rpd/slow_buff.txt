Slow is a status effect in Remixed Dungeon that reduces a character's action speed and may have other effects.

==== Effect ====
When affected by the Slow effect:
  * **Reduced Action Speed:** Action speed is decreased, causing slower actions
  * **Duration:** The effect lasts for a specific duration
  * **Attack Speed:** Attacking speed is reduced, affecting combat effectiveness

==== Application ====
The Slow effect can be applied through various sources:
  * [[rpd:wand_of_slowness_item|Wand of Slowness]] - Direct spell effect that applies slow
  * [[rpd:slow_enchantment|Slow Enchantment]] - On weapons may cause slowness
  * [[rpd:slow_spell|Slow Spell]] - Direct spell effect
  * Certain enemies with slow-creating abilities

==== Mechanics ====
  * Speed reduction affects the rate at which actions are performed
  * May reduce both attack speed and other action speeds
  * The effect wears off over time or can be cleared by certain means
  * Characters can still act while slowed but at a reduced rate

==== Strategic Considerations ====
  * **Benefits for enemies:** Can severely limit player's combat effectiveness
  * **Risks:** Makes the affected character vulnerable to attacks due to slower response
  * **Counters:** Speed-enhancing effects or items can counteract slowness
