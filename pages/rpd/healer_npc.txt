====== Healer NPC ======

{{ rpd:images:healernpc_sprite.png|Healer NPC }}

The **Healer NPC** is a non-player character found in town who provides healing services and plays a role in unlocking the Gnoll Guardian subclass.

==== Description ====
The Healer NPC is found in the town area and provides healing services in exchange for gold. The Healer can heal both the player character and their pet companions.

==== Services ====
  * **Hero Healing:** Heals the player character for 75 gold
  * **Pet Healing:** Heals all pet companions for 50 gold per pet
  * **Hunger Satisfaction:** Satisfies hunger when healing (cures starving status)

==== Special Interaction - Gnoll Subclass Unlock ====
  * The Healer plays a crucial role in unlocking the [[rpd:guardian_subclass|Guardian]] subclass for the Gnoll hero class
  * When the player brings a [[rpd:brute_mob|Brute]] mob to the Healer and pays to heal it, this action triggers the "Gnoll Unlocked" badge
  * Once the badge is earned, Gnoll characters will automatically receive the [[rpd:tome_of_mastery_item|Tome of Mastery]] at the start of the game to choose the Guardian subclass

==== Cost ====
  * Hero healing: 75 gold (may be reduced by Ring of Haggler)
  * Pet healing: 50 gold per pet (may be reduced by Ring of Haggler)

==== Strategy ====
  * Visit the Healer early in the game if you need to restore health or satisfy hunger
  * Bring pet companions to the Healer when they take damage during dungeon exploration
  * For Gnoll players, consider finding and escorting a Brute to the Healer to unlock the Guardian subclass (if playing with mods that allow this)
