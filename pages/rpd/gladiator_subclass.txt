====== Gladiator Subclass ======

{{ rpd:images:hero_WARRIOR_GLADIATOR.png|Gladiator Subclass }}

The **Gladiator** is the Warrior's subclass in Remixed Dungeon. This mastery path focuses on sustained melee combat and building devastating attack combos.

==== Unlocking ====
The Gladiator subclass can be unlocked by using a [[rpd:tome_of_mastery|Tome of Mastery]] after defeating the second boss (Tengu). The Tome of Mastery is typically obtained by defeating the second boss (Tengu) in the dungeon.

==== Special Mechanics ====
A successful attack with a melee weapon allows the Gladiator to start a combo. After 2 successful consecutive hits (for a total of 3), each additional hit increases damage by an additional 20% (the damage bonus increases linearly with hit count). The combo is broken if a hit misses or if the Gladiator takes damage.

  * **Damage Bonus Formula**: (hit count - 2) / 5, meaning:
    * 3rd hit: 20% damage bonus
    * 4th hit: 40% damage bonus
    * 5th hit: 60% damage bonus
    * And so on...

==== Special Armor ====
Using an [[rpd:armor_kit|Armor Kit]] on any armor will transform it into the [[rpd:gladiator_armor|Gladiator Armor]], which is specifically designed for this subclass. This armor provides special abilities that synergize with the Gladiator's combat style.

==== Advantages ====
  * Can build devastating combos with melee weapons
  * After 3 successful hits, damage increases by 20% per additional hit
  * Effective for sustained melee combat
  * Synergizes well with high-durability weapons that can withstand prolonged use

==== Disadvantages ====
  * Requires consecutive hits to be effective
  * Combo is broken if a hit misses or if the Gladiator takes damage
  * Less effective against highly evasive enemies
  * Requires careful positioning to maintain combo streaks

==== Strategy ====
  * Focus on melee weapons with good durability to maintain combo potential
  * Target enemies that are less likely to dodge your attacks
  * Use the combo system to take down powerful enemies efficiently
  * Consider using armor or items that prevent combo breakage
  * Position carefully to avoid taking damage that would break your combo

==== Note about Page Naming ====
This page follows the current wiki convention for hero subclass pages using the `_subclass` suffix. If you arrived here from an old link, please note that hero subclass pages now use the format `subclass_name_subclass.txt` (e.g., `gladiator_subclass.txt`, `berserker_subclass.txt`) instead of just `subclass_name.txt`.
