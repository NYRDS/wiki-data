{{ rpd:images:item_ScrollOfTeleportation.png|Scroll of Teleportation }}

The **Scroll of Teleportation** is a type of scroll in [[rpd:remixed_dungeon|Remixed Dungeon]] that instantly transports the reader to a random location on the current dungeon level.

==== Effects ====
When read, the Scroll of Teleportation:
  * Instantly moves the player to a random accessible location on the current level
  * Does not consume stairs or other level transitions
  * Works when enemies are adjacent (unlike drinking potions)
  * Can be used to escape dangerous situations
  * Does not work in special areas like [[rpd:shops|shops]] or treasure rooms

==== Usage ====
The scroll can be useful for:
  * Escaping dangerous situations with no other options
  * Relocating to explore unvisited areas of a level
  * Finding [[rpd:stairs|stairs]] if you're lost
  * Retreating from difficult enemies
  * Reaching different parts of a level without backtracking

==== Acquisition ====
The Scroll of Teleportation can be found in:
  * [[rpd:chests_mechanic|Chests]] in the dungeon
  * [[rpd:shops|Shops]] (occasionally available)
  * As a drop from certain enemies
  * In [[rpd:treasury|Treasury]] levels

==== Strategy ====
  * Most valuable when surrounded by dangerous enemies
  * Can be risky as destination is random (may land near other enemies)
  * Useful on levels with large open areas where you need to traverse quickly
  * Good to carry one or two for emergency situations
  * Does not work if all level cells are blocked (very rare situation)
