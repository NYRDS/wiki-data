Gnoll Zombies are undead versions of gnolls that have been reanimated through dark magic. They retain some characteristics of their original form while gaining undead properties.

==== Description ====
Gnoll Zombies are the reanimated corpses of gnolls, one of the dungeon's humanoid enemies. They combine the physical characteristics and abilities of gnolls with the resilience and immunities of undead creatures.

==== Combat ====
  * **Health:** High, as both gnolls and undead tend to be durable
  * **Attack:** Melee attacks that may be stronger than regular zombie attacks
  * **Abilities:** 
    * Standard undead traits (immune to poison, bleeding, etc.)
    * Potentially retains some gnoll-specific abilities
    * May have higher damage than regular zombies

==== Characteristics ====
  * **Undead Nature:** Immune to effects that target living tissue
  * **Physical Resilience:** Combination of gnoll toughness and undead durability
  * **Movement:** Likely slower than living gnolls, but potentially more dangerous than regular zombies

==== Location ====
Gnoll Zombies can be found in:
  * Areas where gnolls typically dwell
  * [[rpd:sewers|Sewers]] levels where gnolls might be found
  * Undead-heavy areas of the dungeon
  * Anywhere undead creatures are reanimated

==== Tactics ====
  * Treat as a more dangerous version of both zombies and gnolls
  * Use fire or holy damage which is typically effective against undead
  * Be prepared for higher damage output than regular zombies
  * Area attacks can be useful against groups
  * Positioning is important as they may have higher attack power than basic undead
