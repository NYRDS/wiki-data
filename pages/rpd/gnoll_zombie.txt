  * **Experience:** 7 EXP for killing
  * **Maximum Level:** 35

==== Description ====
Twisted, broken body of a zombie gnoll no longer resembles a humanoid or a hyena. All that's left is just a pile of rotten flesh and bones filled with malicious urge to kill and consume.

==== Special Abilities ====
  * **Resurrection:** Has a 35% chance to rise from the dead when killed (unless killed by fire)
  * **Immunities:** Immune to Paralysis and Toxic Gas due to undead nature

==== Combat Strategy ====
Zombie Gnolls are particularly dangerous enemies because:
  * They have high health, damage, and defense stats
  * They can resurrect when killed (35% chance), making them difficult to permanently defeat
  * They are immune to several status effects (Paralysis, Toxic Gas)
  * Their high damage output can be threatening in close combat
  * The resurrection ability is negated if killed by fire damage

==== Location ====
Zombie Gnolls appear in the Goo's level (Guts) of the dungeon, typically in areas where gnolls might have originally lived.

==== Tactics ====
  * Be very careful when fighting, as they can resurrect after being killed (35% chance)
  * Use fire-based attacks to prevent resurrection when possible
  * Keep distance when possible due to their high damage output
  * Be prepared for a longer fight due to their high HP and damage reduction
