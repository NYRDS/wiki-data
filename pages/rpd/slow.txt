{{ rpd:images:slow_effect.png|Slow Effect }}

Slow is a status effect in Remixed Dungeon that reduces the affected character's movement and action speed.

==== Description ====
When a character is under the effect of Slow, their speed is significantly reduced. This affects movement, attacking, and all other actions, making them take longer to complete.

==== Effects ====
  * **Speed Reduction:** Affected characters have their speed significantly reduced
  * **Haste Level:** Reduces haste level by -7.27254 (hasteLevel method in code)
  * **Duration:** Standard duration is 10 turns, modified by resistance effects
  * **Visual Indicator:** Affected characters display a specific status animation

==== Causes ====
  * [[rpd:ice_elemental|Ice Elemental]] - Has a 33% chance to apply Slow on attack
  * [[rpd:slow|Slow Enchantment]] - Weapon enchantment that applies slow effect
  * [[rpd:slow_spell|Slow Spell]] - Spell that applies slow effect
  * Certain enemy attacks - Some creatures can apply slow with their attacks

==== Countering the Effect ====
  * The effect will naturally wear off after the duration expires
  * [[rpd:ring_of_elements|Ring of Elements]] may provide resistance to reduce duration
  * Some items may remove negative status effects

==== Immunities ====
Some creatures are immune to the Slow effect:
  * [[rpd:lich_mob|Lich]]
  * [[rpd:piranha|Piranha]]
  * [[rpd:undead_mobs|Undead creatures]] - Often have resistance or immunity
  * [[rpd:pasty_mimic|Pasty-Mimic]] - Immune to various status effects

==== Strategy ====
  * For players: Try to avoid being slowed in dangerous situations
  * For players: The slow effect can be debilitating when surrounded by enemies
  * For enemies: Slowing powerful enemies can give valuable breathing room
  * Consider using ranged weapons or spells to avoid being affected by your own slow effects
