====== Food Ration ======

This is the normal food in the game, along with pasty and fish. This satisfies starvation and can be found on most levels.

Food ration can also be obtained from defeating //Dwarf monk//. This makes the underground city a good place to obtain food. (**If you're strong enough**)

There is also another variety of the food ration:**Overpriced food ration**
This looks similar to the normal ration but it satisfies less hunger, it is expensive, and it is limited in stock.
