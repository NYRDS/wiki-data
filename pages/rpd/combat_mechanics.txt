==== Core Combat System ====
Combat in Remixed Dungeon is turn-based. Each character has 100 "energy" which accumulates at a rate of 10 per turn. When energy reaches 100, the character can act. Attacking, moving, and using items or abilities all consume time, which determines how much time the hero and enemy take to perform that action.

==== Attacking ====
  * Attacking consists of two checks: **Accuracy** vs **Evasion** (to determine hit), followed by **Damage** vs **Armor** (to determine damage)
  * If armor negates all damage, the hit is considered "parried"
  * Weapons have accuracy and damage bonuses, while armor has a defense value

==== Accuracy and Evasion ====
  * **Accuracy** determines the chance to land a hit
  * **Evasion** determines the chance to avoid being hit
  * Level difference affects accuracy (higher level attackers have better accuracy, lower level have better evasion)

==== Damage and Defense ====
  * Damage is reduced by armor. The formula is: damage = damage - random(0, armor)
  * This means higher armor values provide better protection, but even high armor doesn't guarantee damage reduction

==== Special Combat Effects ====
  * **[[rpd:critical_hits|Critical Hits]]** - Random chance to deal extra damage
  * **[[rpd:bleeding_buff|Bleeding]]** - Damage over time
  * **[[rpd:poison_buff|Poison]]** - Damage over time based on remaining HP
  * **[[rpd:fire|Fire]]** - Damage over time
  * **[[rpd:control_effects|Control Effects]]** - Effects that limit enemy actions

==== Ranged Combat ====
  * Ranged weapons can attack from multiple tiles away
  * Thrown weapons like darts and shurikens have limited quantity
  * Bows and crossbows require corresponding ammunition

==== Melee Combat ====
  * Requires being adjacent to the target
  * Most weapons and spells affect melee combat
  * **[[rpd:melee_combat|Melee Combat Specifics]]** - Additional mechanics for close combat

==== Combat Tactics ====
  * Always try to fight one enemy at a time
  * Use terrain to your advantage (doorways, choke points)
  * Maintain distance when facing multiple enemies
  * Be aware of environmental hazards during combat
