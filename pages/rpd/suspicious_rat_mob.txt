====== Suspicious Rat ======

{{ rpd:images:suspiciousrat_sprite.png|Suspicious Rat }}

The Suspicious Rat is a unique mob found in the Guts level of Remixed Dungeon. This mob has a distinctive behavior pattern where it transforms into a Pseudo Rat when threatened.

==== Description ====
A rat is not an uncommon sight in the dungeons, but for it to dwell so deep... You can see how the rat's whole body spasms when it moves. It appears sickly and unstable, with noticeable tremors throughout its body.

==== Special Mechanics ====
  * **Transformation**: When the Suspicious Rat detects an enemy, it will transform into a Pseudo Rat after a short delay
  * **Pacified State**: The rat remains pacified until it sees an enemy
  * **Transformation Time**: Takes 4f time units to transform once threatened
  * **Pump-Up Delay**: 2.2f time units (matches Goo's pump-up delay)
  * **Immunity**: Immune to Toxic Gas damage

==== Stats ====
  * **HP**: 140
  * **HT**: 140
  * **Defense Skill**: 25
  * **Attack Skill**: 25
  * **Damage**: 10-15
  * **DR**: 2
  * **EXP**: 1
  * **Max Level**: 30

==== Behavior ====
When the Suspicious Rat spots an enemy, it begins to transform. After 4 time units, it will disappear and a [[rpd:pseudo_rat_mob|Pseudo Rat]] will spawn in its place. The transformation is triggered when the rat sees an enemy, not when attacked. This makes it dangerous to approach, as killing it might result in a more formidable opponent.

==== Spawn Location ====
  * Guts Level (floors 26-30) - according to Bestiary.json configuration

==== Strategy ====
  * Be cautious when approaching Suspicious Rats, as they will transform into Pseudo Rats
  * The transformation occurs after about 4 turns of being in combat range
  * Consider using ranged attacks to defeat them before they transform
  * The Pseudo Rat that spawns is significantly stronger than the Suspicious Rat
