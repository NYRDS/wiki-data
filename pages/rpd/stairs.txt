====== Stairs ======

{{ rpd:images:stairs.png|Stairs}}

**Stairs** are essential elements in Remixed Dungeon that allow the hero to travel between dungeon levels. There are two main types of stairs that facilitate vertical movement through the dungeon.

==== Types of Stairs ====

==== Downward Stairs ====
  * Allow the hero to descend to deeper levels of the dungeon
  * Appear automatically on each level except the final level (Halls level 25)
  * Marked with a '>' symbol on the dungeon map
  * Required to progress deeper into the dungeon
  * Once descended, can only be returned to using an [[rpd:amulet_item|Amulet of Yendor]]

==== Upward Stairs ====
  * Allow the hero to ascend to higher levels of the dungeon
  * Appear on most levels (except the first level of each area)
  * Marked with a '<' symbol on the dungeon map
  * Allow retreat to higher levels or return to town
  * Can be used to backtrack to previous levels (until the hero goes deeper)

==== Special Properties ====
  * Stairs are always visible on the dungeon map (not hidden behind fog of war)
  * They're safe tiles - no random events occur when standing on stairs
  * Stairs cannot be destroyed or blocked by enemies
  * When entering a level, the hero appears on the upward stairs (or the entrance on level 1)

==== Usage Strategy ====
  * It's often beneficial to explore a level fully before descending
  * Upward stairs can be used to retreat from dangerous situations
  * Some players use upward stairs to rest (regenerate HP/MP) away from wandering monsters
  * In challenges that prevent return to town, upward stairs stop appearing after level 1
