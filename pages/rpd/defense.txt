====== Defense ======

Defense in Remixed Pixel Dungeon refers to the mechanics that protect the player and enemies from damage. Understanding defense is crucial for effective gameplay and character development.

==== Player Defense Calculation ====
Player defense is determined by several factors:
  * **Armor Class**: Provides the primary defense rating based on armor level
  * **Evasion**: Affects the chance to dodge incoming attacks
  * **Shield Rating**: Additional defense provided by equipped shields
  * **Buff Effects**: Temporary defenses from various status effects

==== Defense Statistics ====
  * **Defense Skill**: Affects the chance to successfully block attacks
  * **Defense Rating (DR)**: Directly reduces incoming physical damage
  * **Elemental Resistances**: Reduces damage from elemental attacks (fire, cold, etc.)

==== Defense Mechanics ====
  * **Blocking Chance**: Calculated based on Defense Skill vs Enemy Attack Skill
  * **Damage Reduction**: DR subtracts directly from incoming damage
  * **Critical Avoidance**: Higher defense stats reduce critical hit chance against you

==== Defense Strategies ====
  * **Equipment**: Higher tier armor provides better defense ratings
  * **Enchantments**: Armor glyphs can provide additional defensive benefits
  * **Evasion**: Higher dexterity increases dodge chance
  * **Tactical Positioning**: Using doors and choke points to reduce number of attackers
