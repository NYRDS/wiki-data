The Shaman is the Elf's subclass in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Unlocking ====
The Shaman subclass can be unlocked by using a [[rpd:tome_of_mastery_item|Tome of Mastery]] after defeating the second boss (Tengu).

==== Special Mechanics ====
Elven _Shamans_ can use wands as melee weapons. Successful hits have a 25% chance (1 in 4) to zap the target with the wand's power without consuming a charge.

==== Technical Details ====
  * **Implementation:** The Shaman's special mechanics are implemented in the ''attackProc'' method of ''HeroSubClass.java''
  * **Wand Activation:** When a Shaman attacks with a wand equipped, there's a 25% chance to activate the wand on the target without consuming a charge
  * **Code Reference:** The specific implementation checks if the primary weapon is a wand and has charges, then activates it at the enemy's position

==== Special Armor ====
Using an [[rpd:armor_kit_item|Armor Kit]] on any armor will transform it into the [[rpd:shaman_armor_item|Shaman Armor]], which is specifically designed for this subclass.

==== Advantages ====
  * Can use wands as melee weapons
  * 25% chance to activate wand powers without consuming charges
  * Versatile weapon options combining ranged and melee
  * Preserves wand charges when power activates
  * Synergizes well with all wand types
  * +1 dew bonus for enhanced mana recovery

==== Disadvantages ====
  * Activation chance is not guaranteed (25% chance)
  * Wand damage as melee weapon may be lower than dedicated weapons
