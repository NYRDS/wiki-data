The Shaman is the Elf's subclass in Remixed Dungeon.

===== Description =====
Elven _Shamans_ can use wands as melee weapons. Successful hits have a chance to activate the wand's power on a target without using a charge.

===== Unlocking =====
The Shaman subclass can be unlocked by using a [[rpd:tome_of_mastery_item|Tome of Mastery]] after defeating the second boss (Tengu).

===== Special Mechanics =====
  * Elven _Shamans_ can use wands as melee weapons
  * When attacking with a wand equipped, there's a 25% chance (1 in 4) to zap the target with the wand's power without consuming a charge
  * This ability is implemented in the ''attackProc'' method of ''HeroSubClass.java''
  * The wand must be equipped as the primary weapon for this mechanic to work
  * +1 dew bonus for enhanced mana recovery

  * **Wand Activation:** When a Shaman attacks with a wand equipped, there's a 25% chance to activate the wand on the target without consuming a charge
  * **Code Reference:** The specific implementation checks if the primary weapon is a wand and has charges, then activates it at the enemy's position

===== Special Armor =====
Using an [[rpd:armor_kit_item|Armor Kit]] on any armor will transform it into the [[rpd:shaman_armor_item|Shaman Armor]], which is specifically designed for this subclass.
