  * **Self-Damage:** Random damage (1-5 points) dealt to the player every turn with 10% probability when HP is above 1/5 of maximum
  * **Visual Effect:** Bloodlust icon indicator
  * **Duration:** Lasts as long as the Corpse Dust artifact remains equipped

==== Effect ====
When under the influence of Rage:
  * **Offensive:** Attack power is significantly increased, making combat more effective
  * **Risk:** Periodic damage to the player character creates dangerous situations
  * **Strategy:** High-risk, high-reward combat approach

  * **Self-Damage Chance:** 10% per turn when HP > 20% of maximum
