The **Priest Vestments** (internal name: Priest Armor) is the class-specific armor for the [[rpd:priest|Priest]] class in Remixed Pixel Dungeon. It's designed to support the Priest's healing and purification abilities.

==== Description ====
Like other class armors, the Priest Vestments have unique special abilities accessible through the Special action. However, the current implementation of the Priest Vestments is a placeholder with no special ability implemented.

==== Special Ability ====
Currently, the Priest Vestments have no implemented special ability:
* The special() method returns an empty string
* The doSpecial() method is empty and performs no action

==== Implementation Notes ====
The Priest Vestments class serves as a placeholder for future implementation. While it extends ClassArmor like other class armors, its special abilities have not yet been programmed.

==== Class Restriction ====
This armor can only be effectively used by the Priest class. If worn by other classes, it may not function properly.
