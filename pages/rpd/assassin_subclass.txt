====== Assassin Subclass ======

{{ rpd:images:hero_ROGUE_ASSASSIN.png|Assassin }}

The Assassin is the Rogue's subclass in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Unlocking ====
The Assassin subclass can be unlocked by using a Tome of Mastery after defeating the second boss (Tengu).

==== Special Mechanics ====
When the Assassin attacks an enemy that is unaware of the Assassin's presence, the Assassin gets bonus damage. This happens when the enemy cannot see the Assassin (such as when the Assassin is invisible or out of the enemy's line of sight). The bonus damage is calculated as a random amount between 1 and the base damage dealt by the Assassin.

==== Special Armor ====
Using an [[rpd:armor_kit_item|Armor Kit]] on any armor will transform it into the [[rpd:assassin_armor_item|Assassin Armor]], which is specifically designed for this subclass.

==== Advantages ====
  * Bonus damage back to enemies when they attack the unseen Assassin
  * Effective for stealth-based gameplay
  * High damage potential when enemies attack an invisible or out-of-sight Assassin
  * Synergizes well with invisible or out-of-sight positioning

==== Disadvantages ====
  * Only effective when enemies attack the unseen Assassin
  * Requires careful positioning and stealth
  * Less effective in direct confrontation situations
