**Assassin** is a [[rpd:subclass|subclass]] for the [[rpd:rogue_class|Rogue]] class.

==== Description ====
The Assassin is a subclass of the Rogue that specializes in stealth and high-damage attacks. This subclass provides enhanced abilities for ambushing enemies and dealing critical damage from stealth.

==== Special Abilities ====
  * **Note:** Currently, no specific game mechanics are implemented for the Assassin subclass in the codebase beyond the general Rogue class mechanics
  * The game description states: "When performing a surprise attack, the _Assassin_ inflicts additional damage to his target," but this is not currently implemented in the code
  * All special abilities are conceptual based on the class description rather than implemented mechanics

==== Strategy ====
  * Since there are no special implemented mechanics, play as a standard Rogue subclass
  * Focus on the general Rogue playstyle of stealth and positioning
  * Utilize stealth-enhancing items like the [[rpd:ring_of_shadows_item|Ring of Shadows]]
  * Use Rogue skills and abilities that are available to all Rogues

==== Technical Details ====
