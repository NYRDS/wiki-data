{{ rpd:images:item_WandOfPoison.png|Wand of Poison }}

The **Wand of Poison** is a magical wand in Remixed Dungeon that inflicts the [[rpd:poison|Poison]] status effect on targeted enemies.

==== Stats ====
  * **Charges:** 2 (base) + 1 per upgrade level (max 9 charges)
  * **Recharge:** Gradual recharge during gameplay when below maximum charges
  * **Effect Duration:** 5 + effective level turns (affected by target's poison resistance)

==== Description ====
The Wand of Poison releases a bolt of toxic energy that poisons its target. When used against an enemy, it inflicts the poison status effect causing damage over time. The poison will last for 5 + the wand's effective level turns, with the duration affected by the target's resistance (e.g., from [[rpd:ring_of_elements_item|Ring of Elements]]).

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Effect:** Applies the Poison status effect for (5 + effective level) turns
  * **Target:** Single target in line of sight
  * **Range:** Limited by Ballistica distance calculation
  * **Effectiveness:** Duration affected by target's poison resistance (from Ring of Elements, etc.)
  * **Damage:** Poison damage is (time remaining / 3) + 1 per turn
  * **Recharge:** Recharges gradually during gameplay when below maximum charges

==== Strategy ====
  * Excellent for dealing sustained damage without direct engagement
  * Particularly effective against enemies that don't kill you immediately, allowing the poison to work
  * Good against groups when enemies are adjacent to each other (poison may spread)
  * Less effective against poison-immune creatures or undead
  * Use to soften powerful enemies before direct combat
  * Effective against high-HP enemies that take time to defeat

==== Availability ====
  * Found in stores and occasionally as dungeon loot
  * Can be used by the [[rpd:wandmaker|Wandmaker]] NPC to create upgraded versions
  * Relatively common wand type
