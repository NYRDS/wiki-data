{{ rpd:images:hero_HUNTRESS_WARDEN.png|Warden }}

The Warden is the [[rpd:huntress_class|Huntress]]'s subclass in Remixed Dungeon, specializing in nature-based mechanics.

==== Description ====
Having a strong connection with forces of nature gives _Wardens_ an ability to gather dewdrops and seeds from plants. Also trampling a high grass grants them a temporary armor buff.

==== Unlocking ====
The Warden subclass can be unlocked by using a [[rpd:tome_of_mastery_item|Tome of Mastery]] after defeating the second boss (Tengu). It's one of two possible subclasses for the Huntress, the other being [[rpd:sniper_subclass|Sniper]].

==== Special Mechanics ====
  * **Increased Dew Collection**: Wardens collect more dewdrops from plants than other classes
  * **Seed Collection**: Wardens can gather seeds from plants that other classes might miss
  * **Grass Trampling**: Trampling high grass provides a temporary armor buff (ShieldBuff), making Wardens excel in grassy areas
  * **Enhanced Plant Interaction**: Better synergy with plant-based systems throughout the dungeon

==== Special Armor ====
Using an [[rpd:armor_kit_item|Armor Kit]] on any armor will transform it into the [[rpd:warden_armor_item|Warden Armor]], which is specifically designed for this subclass and features the Spectral Blades ability.

==== Advantages ====
  * Enhanced resource gathering from plants (dewdrops and seeds)
  * Temporary armor buff when trampling high grass
  * Strong sustainability in areas with vegetation
  * Synergizes well with plant mechanics and the [[rpd:sewers|Sewers]] level
  * Access to [[rpd:warden_armor_item|Warden Armor]] with Spectral Blades ability

==== Disadvantages ====
  * Benefits are most significant in areas with plants and high grass
  * Less effective in areas with sparse vegetation
  * Temporary armor buff from grass has limited duration

==== Stats ====
  * **Related Class**: [[rpd:huntress_class|Huntress]]
  * **Alternative Subclass**: [[rpd:sniper_subclass|Sniper]]
  * **Badge Tracking**: [[rpd:badges|Badges]] track achievements specifically for Warden subclass

==== Strategy ====
  * Focus on levels with abundant vegetation like the [[rpd:sewers|Sewers]] and [[rpd:prison|Prison]] where grassy areas are common
  * Make use of the temporary armor buff when moving through high grass
  * Collect dewdrops and seeds more efficiently than other classes
  * Consider the Warden's plant-based benefits when planning your playthrough
