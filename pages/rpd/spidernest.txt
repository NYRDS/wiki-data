====== Spider Nest (Mob) ======

{{ rpd:images:spidernest_sprite.png|Spider Nest Mob }}

The **Spider Nest** is a special static mob in Remixed Dungeon that appears primarily in the [[rpd:spiders|Spider Nest]] area of the dungeon. Unlike other mobs, it cannot move and instead serves as a spawning point for other spider creatures.

==== Mechanics ====
  * **HP:** 10
  * **Movement:** Cannot move (speed = 0)
  * **Spawn Rate:** Spawns a random mob every 20 turns
  * **Experience:** 0 EXP when killed
  * **Max Level:** 9 (does not appear above this level)
  * **Damage:** 0 (does not attack)
  * **Defense:** Low (base defense skill = 2)
  * **Loot:** 20% chance to drop Potion of Healing when killed

==== Behavior ====
  * The Spider Nest is stationary and cannot be moved
  * Every 20 turns, it spawns a random mob using ''MobSpawner.spawnRandomMob(level, pos, 20)''
  * It has no offensive capabilities (0 damage minimum and maximum)
  * Defeating it yields no experience points

==== Strategy ====
  * Focus on destroying Spider Nests to prevent continuous spawning of spider mobs
  * Since they don't move or attack, they can be safely kited around if needed
  * Be aware of the continuous spawning if you choose to fight near one
  * They can be useful for farming healing potions (20% drop rate)
