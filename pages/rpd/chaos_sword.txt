====== Chaos Sword ======

Created by using a fully identified [[rpd:chaos_crystal_item|Chaos Crystal]] (50+ charges) to "fuse" with any melee weapon via the crystal's **Fuse** action.

==== Stats ====
  * **Damage:** Varies based on original weapon
  * **Durability:** Normal
  * **Strength Required:** Varies based on original weapon
  * **Level:** Starts at +0, increases with combat damage dealt

==== Special Properties ====
  * A chaotic weapon with unpredictable but powerful effects
  * Gains levels when the owner deals damage with it (level increases with damage dealt)
  * Loses all enchantments and degrades to +0 at specific level thresholds (level 4+ will reset to +0 when charge reaches 0)
  * Can be any melee weapon type (sword, axe, mace, etc.) depending on the original weapon fused

==== Mechanics ====
The Chaos Sword's level increases as the wielder deals damage. At certain levels (starting at level 4), when its internal charge counter reaches 0, it will downgrade to +0 level but retain its base weapon type and any previous enchantments are lost. The charge required to reach the next level is calculated as `5 * (current_level^1.5)`.

==== Acquisition ====
  * Use the **Fuse** action on a Chaos Crystal (requires 50+ charges and crystal to be fully identified)
  * Select any melee weapon to fuse with
  * The Chaos Crystal will transform the selected weapon into a Chaos Sword

==== Notes ====
Chaos Sword is a unique weapon that converts any melee weapon into a chaotic variant. The chaotic energy within makes it extremely effective but difficult to control. Unlike other weapons, it doesn't have a static enchantment but constantly evolves through combat.
