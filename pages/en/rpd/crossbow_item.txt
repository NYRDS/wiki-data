Crossbows are a type of [[en:rpd:ranged_weapon|ranged weapon]] in Remixed Dungeon that offer higher damage than regular bows at the cost of attack speed.

==== Description ====
Crossbows are advanced ranged weapons that fire bolts with high accuracy and power. They are more difficult to use than regular bows, requiring more time between shots but dealing significantly more damage.

==== Weapon Properties ====
  * **Range:** Excellent range for attacking enemies from a distance
  * **Ammunition:** Requires [[en:rpd:bolts_item|bolts]] to function (if implemented)
  * **Accuracy:** Very high accuracy
  * **Speed:** Slower attack speed compared to regular bows
  * **Damage:** Higher damage output than regular bows
  * **Upgrade Potential:** Can be upgraded with [[en:rpd:scroll_of_upgrade_item|Scrolls of Upgrade]]
  * **Enchantments:** Compatible with [[en:rpd:weapon_enchantments|weapon enchantments]]

==== Available Crossbows ====
  * **Crossbow** - Basic crossbow weapon
  * **Composite Crossbow** - Enhanced version with better stats
  * **Other variants** - Various crossbow types (details to be added)

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Ammunition System:** Each shot consumes one bolt (if implemented)
  * **High Damage:** Sacrifices speed for increased damage per shot
  * **Line of Sight:** Requires clear line of sight to target
  * **Ranged Combat:** Allows attacking without direct engagement
  * **Powerful Shots:** Each bolt hits harder than a typical arrow

==== Strategy ====
  * Crossbows are ideal for high-damage, precision shots
  * Best used against single powerful enemies
