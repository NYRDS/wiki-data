====== Embers Level Object ======

{{ rpd:images:embers_level_object.png|Embers }}

**Embers** are a level object that temporarily appears when fire expires on natural terrain in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Description ====
When fire expires on natural terrain in the dungeon, it leaves behind embers that remain visible for a short period of time. The embers are a transitional terrain type between burning fire and normal floor tiles.

==== Properties ====
  * **Type**: [[en:rpd:level_objects|Level Object]]
  * **Duration**: Temporary terrain that eventually returns to normal floor
  * **Effect**: Acts as a normal floor tile for movement and interactions
  * **Origin**: Created when [[en:rpd:fire_mechanic|fire]] expires on flammable terrain

==== Mechanics ====
  * Embers appear automatically when fire naturally expires on flammable terrain
  * They gradually fade back to regular floor tiles over time
  * Players and creatures can move through embers normally
  * Do not cause damage like active fire

==== Appearance ====
  * Darker, cooler-looking than active fire
  * Visually represents the burnt remains of flammable terrain
  * Less intense glow compared to active fire
