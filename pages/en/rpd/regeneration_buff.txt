**Regeneration** is a beneficial status effect in Remixed Dungeon that gradually restores health over time.

==== Effect Description ====
  * **Type:** Beneficial Status Effect (Buff)
  * **Effect:** Gradually restores HP over time based on hero's stats and equipment
  * **Duration:** Limited time period (continues until manually removed or hero dies)
  * **Stacking:** Does not stack with other healing effects in most cases
  * **Rate:** Affected by Regeneration Delay (REGENERATION_DELAY = 10) and various bonuses

==== How to Obtain ====
  * From certain potions (e.g., [[en:rpd:potion_of_healing_item|Potion of Healing]])
  * From specific equipment with healing properties (e.g., Ring of Mending)
  * From hero class and subclass abilities (e.g., HeroSubClass.regenerationBonus)
  * From environmental features in certain levels (when not in safe zones)
  * Through game facilitations (FAST_REGENERATION)

==== Mechanics ====
  * Restores a small amount of HP each turn based on hero's stats and equipment
  * Effect is applied periodically with REGENERATION_DELAY = 10 (from source code)
  * Rate is modified by hero's regenerationBonus (from equipped items, subclasses, etc.)
  * Does not function in safe zones/levels (like town or city areas) - checked via level().isSafe()
  * Does not function if the character is starving (checked via isStarving())
  * More effective when combined with other healing methods (synergistic effect)

==== Code References ====

  * **Source Code Location:** RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/watabou/pixeldungeon/actors/buffs/Regeneration.java
  * **Regeneration Delay Constant:** REGENERATION_DELAY = 10 (see line 13 in source)
  * **Facilitations:** FAST_REGENERATION constant defined in Facilitations.java
  * **Hero Interaction:** Hero class automatically applies Regeneration in Hero.java (line 236)
  * **Immunities:** Some mobs like Shopkeeper have immunities to Regeneration (see Shopkeeper.java)
  * **CharModifier Interface:** Regeneration rate can be modified via CharModifier.regenerationBonus() method

==== String Resources ====
  * [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/res/values/strings_all.xml#L600|RegenerationBuff_Name]] - "Natural Regeneration"
  * [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/res/values/strings_all.xml#L601|RegenerationBuff_Info]] - "The function for natural regeneration is in a buff form to make things easier."

==== Strategy ====
  * Use during non-safe dungeon areas to restore health without consuming potions
  * Particularly valuable during long dungeon runs when healing resources are scarce
  * Does not work when resting in safe areas like town or city (by design)
  * Prioritize during combat to maintain health pool in dangerous areas
  * Combine with equipment like Ring of Mending for faster regeneration

==== Counters ====
  * Damage over time effects (Poison, Bleeding) may reduce effectiveness
  * Dispel effects can remove regeneration
  * Starvation status prevents regeneration from functioning
  * Safe zones prevent regeneration from functioning
