**Regeneration** is a beneficial status effect in Remixed Dungeon that gradually restores health over time.

==== Effect Description ====
  * **Type:** Beneficial Status Effect (Buff)
  * **Effect:** Gradually restores HP over time
  * **Duration:** Limited time period
  * **Stacking:** Does not stack with other healing effects in most cases

==== How to Obtain ====
  * From certain potions (e.g., [[en:rpd:potion_of_healing_item|Potion of Healing]])
  * From specific equipment with healing properties
  * From class abilities or spells
  * From environmental features in certain levels

==== Mechanics ====
  * Restores a small amount of HP each turn
  * Effect is applied periodically over several turns
  * Does not function in safe zones/levels (like town or city areas)
  * Does not function if the character is starving
  * More effective when combined with other healing methods

==== Strategy ====
  * Use during non-safe dungeon areas to restore health without consuming potions
  * Particularly valuable during long dungeon runs
  * Does not work when resting in safe areas like town or city
  * Prioritize during combat to maintain health pool in dangerous areas

==== Counters ====
