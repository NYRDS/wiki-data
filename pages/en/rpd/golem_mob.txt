{{ rpd:images:golem_mob.png|Golem }}

**Golem** is a mechanical mob found in the Prison level of Remixed Dungeon. It's a powerful enemy with high defense and damage, but moves slowly.

==== Stats ====
  * **Level**: 15
  * **HP**: 40
  * **EXP for killing**: 8
  * **Defense**: 15
  * **Accuracy**: 15 (base)
  * **Evasion**: 8
  * **Damage**: 10-20
  * **Speed**: 0.5× (half normal speed)

==== Special Abilities ====
  * **Mechanical**: Immune to many status effects that affect living beings (e.g., poison, bleeding)
  * **Recharge**: Gradually regenerates energy, which can make some attacks stronger
  * **Explosion**: When killed, has a chance to explode dealing damage to adjacent cells
  * **Sturdy Build**: Takes reduced damage from many sources due to its mechanical nature

==== Strategy ====
  * Use high-damage weapons or spells to take it down quickly before it can use its abilities
  * Keep your distance as its slow speed can be used against it
  * Be aware of its explosion ability - standing adjacent when it dies can cause damage
  * Since it's mechanical, status effects like poison won't work on it
  * Ranged attacks are effective since you can stay out of its reach

==== Drops ====
Golems can drop:
