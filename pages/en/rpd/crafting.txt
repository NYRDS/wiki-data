  * **Recipes**: Specific combinations of items that create new items
  * **Moistening**: Using potions on arrows to create special ammunition

  * **Potion + Arrow** → Special arrow (through [[en:rpd:moisten|moistening]])
  * **Seed + Food** → Potion
  * **Scroll + Scroll** → Different scroll
  * **Item + Gold** → Scroll (random type)

==== Strategy ====
  * Convert unwanted items into needed items to optimize inventory
  * Create specialized ammunition for specific situations
  * Generate supplies when resources are running low
  * Use crafting to dispose of cursed items safely
