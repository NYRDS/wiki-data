The **Scroll of Summoning** is a magic scroll in Remixed Dungeon that allows the player to summon a monster from the current dungeon level as an ally.

==== Effect ====
  * **Summoning:** When read aloud, the scroll will summon one of the monsters from the current dungeon level
  * **Ally Creation:** If the monster's will is weak enough, it will become your servant and fight alongside you
  * **Summoning Location:** The monster appears in an empty cell next to the reader

==== Strategy ====
  * Useful for creating temporary allies in difficult fights
  * The summoned monster will help fight your enemies
  * Particularly effective when facing challenging bosses
  * The summoned creature has a chance of becoming a pet if it can be tamed
  * Be careful about the type of monster summoned, as not all can be tamed

==== Restrictions ====
  * Cannot be used in boss levels
  * Requires a valid empty space next to the reader for the monster to appear
  * If no valid cell is available, the scroll will fail to work
