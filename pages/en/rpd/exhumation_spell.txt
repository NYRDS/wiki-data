====== Exhumation ======

Exhumation is a necromantic ability for the [[en:rpd:necromancer_class|Necromancer]] class that allows the performer to open graves and potentially subdue the soul of one lying within.

==== Description ====
Opening the tomb is a sinister act on its own, but not enough for someone serving Death itself. The performer of this Dark Ritual has a great chance (and it will grow with the performer's mastery) to subdue a poor soul of one lying in the grave. This ability allows Necromancers to recruit additional undead minions from burial sites.
