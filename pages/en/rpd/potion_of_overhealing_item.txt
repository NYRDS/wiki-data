{{ rpd:images:potion_of_overhealing_item.png|Potion of Overhealing }}

The **Potion of Overhealing** is a [[en:rpd:potion_item|potion]] in Remixed Dungeon that restores health beyond the drinker's maximum HP, providing temporary health points.

==== Item Overview ====
  * **Type:** [[en:rpd:potion_item|Potion]]
  * **Rarity:** Uncommon
  * **Special Effect:** Heals beyond maximum HP, giving temporary hit points
  * **Usage:** Single use item (consumed upon drinking)
  * **Price:** 50 [[en:rpd:gold|gold]] when identified
  * **[[en:rpd:identification|Identification]]:** Becomes identified when consumed, shattered, or when seen in inventory after being identified

==== Special Mechanics ====
  * **Overhealing:** Restores health that exceeds the maximum HP, adding temporary hit points
  * **Temporary HP:** The extra health received is temporary and will gradually fade over time
  * **Duration:** The temporary health lasts for a number of turns before naturally fading
  * **[[en:rpd:status_effects|Status Effect]] Removal:** Removes [[en:rpd:poison_buff|Poison]], [[en:rpd:cripple_buff|Cripple]], [[en:rpd:weakness_buff|Weakness]], and [[en:rpd:bleeding_buff|Bleeding]] [[en:rpd:status_effects|status effects]]
  * **Shattering:** When shattered on the ground, overheals 25% of max HP as temporary HP to any character on that tile
  * **[[en:rpd:identification|Identification]]:** Becomes identified when consumed, shattered, or when seen in inventory after being identified
  * **Stacking:** Multiple potions can be carried and used as needed
  * **Emergency Use:** Can be used to survive attacks that would otherwise be lethal

==== Strategy ====
  * Essential for surviving dangerous encounters in high-risk situations
  * Best used before anticipated high-damage attacks or boss fights
  * Can be used proactively for maximum safety during dungeon progression
  * Shattering can be useful for overhealing allies or when unable to drink
  * More effective than regular healing potions for high-stakes encounters
  * Good to use before challenging encounters to create a safety buffer
  * Essential for attempting difficult challenges where survivability is critical
  * Temporary health fades gradually, so timing is important
  * More expensive than normal healing potion but offers superior survivability
  * Should be conserved for the most dangerous situations

==== Obtaining ====
  * Found throughout dungeon [[en:rpd:levels|levels]] (less common than regular healing potions)
  * Available in [[en:rpd:shops_mechanic|shops]] at higher prices (50 [[en:rpd:gold|gold]] when identified)
  * Dropped by various [[en:rpd:mobs|enemies]] (more common from magic-oriented enemies)
  * Found in [[en:rpd:chests_mechanic|containers]] and special rooms
  * Alchemically crafted from [[en:rpd:seeds|Life Flowers]] and [[en:rpd:seeds|Sungrass Seeds]] using the [[en:rpd:alchemy_mechanic|alchemy]] pot
  * Less common than [[en:rpd:potion_of_healing_item|Potion of Healing]]

==== Effect ====
When consumed, the Potion of Overhealing restores all current hit points and adds temporary hit points equal to 50% of the maximum HP. These temporary hit points gradually fade over time until only the character's normal maximum HP remains.

According to the game's string resources: "An elixir that will not only return you to full health but grant you temporary health beyond your normal maximum."
