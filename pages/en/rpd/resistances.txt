====== Resistances ======

Resistances in Remixed Dungeon represent reductions in the effectiveness of specific types of attacks or status effects against a character or mob. When a character has resistance to a particular effect, they take less damage or are less likely to be affected.

==== Types of Resistances ====

==== Damage Resistances ====
  * **Physical Resistance**: Reduces damage from physical attacks
  * **Magic Resistance**: Reduces damage from magical attacks
  * **Elemental Resistances**: Reduces damage from elemental attacks (Fire, Cold, Lightning, etc.)

==== Status Effect Resistances ====
  * **Poison Resistance**: Reduces the duration and damage of poison effects
  * **Bleeding Resistance**: Reduces the damage from bleeding effects
  * **Paralysis Resistance**: Reduces the duration of paralysis effects
  * **Fear/Terror Resistance**: Reduces susceptibility to fear-based effects
  * **Charm Resistance**: Reduces susceptibility to charm effects
  * **Sleep Resistance**: Reduces susceptibility to sleep effects

==== Sources of Resistance ====
  * **Armor**: Different types of armor provide various resistances
  * **Rings**: Some rings provide resistances to specific effects
  * **Buffs**: Temporary effects that grant resistance
  * **Abilities**: Some character classes or mobs have innate resistances
  * **Enchantments**: Weapon and armor enchantments may provide resistances

==== How Resistances Work ====
  * Resistances typically reduce the effect by a percentage or fixed amount
  * Some resistances are binary (completely immune or not)
  * Multiple sources of the same resistance may stack to a cap
  * Some effects ignore resistances completely
