====== Poison Trap ======

{{ rpd:images:poison_trap_level_object.png|Poison Trap }}

**Poison Trap** is a type of trap found in the dungeon that releases poison gas when triggered, causing the poison status effect to the character that activates it.

==== Effects ====
  * **Poison Status**: Afflicts the trapped character with the [[en:rpd:poison_buff|poison]] effect
  * **Damage Over Time**: Causes gradual damage until the poison wears off or is cured
  * **Duration**: Poison effect lasts for a limited number of turns
  * **Stacking**: Multiple poison hits increase the damage rate

==== Activation ====
  * **Trigger**: Activates when a character moves onto the trap's cell
  * **One-time**: Becomes harmless after activation
  * **Silent**: Does not alert other enemies (unlike alarm traps)

==== Countermeasures ====
  * **[[en:rpd:potion_of_purity_item|Potion of Purity]]**: Instantly clears poison status
  * **[[en:rpd:ring_of_elements|Ring of Elements]]**: Provides resistance to poison effects
  * **[[en:rpd:herbal_health|Herbal Health ability]]**: May reduce poison duration
  * **Avoidance**: Detecting and avoiding the trap entirely

==== Tengu Usage ====
  * **Strategic Placement**: Tengu creates poison traps during combat as part of his strategy
  * **Area Denial**: Forces the hero to move to specific locations to avoid the traps
  * **Multi-turn Effect**: Continues to damage the hero even after Tengu has moved elsewhere
