====== Inventory ======

{{ rpd:images:scrollholder_sprite.png|Inventory }}

**Inventory** refers to the hero's collection of carried items in Remixed Dungeon, managed through the backpack and various equipped slots.

==== Inventory System ====
  * **Backpack Space**: Limited slots for carrying items
  * **Equipment Slots**: Special slots for weapons, armor, rings, and artifacts
  * **Quickslots**: 4 slots for items that need rapid access during combat
  * **Weight**: Combined weight of all items affects movement speed

==== Equipment Slots ====
  * [[en:rpd:weapons_mechanic|Weapon]] - Main hand weapon slot
  * [[en:rpd:armor|Armor]] - Body armor slot
  * [[en:rpd:ring|Rings]] - Up to 2 ring slots
  * [[en:rpd:artifacts|Artifact]] - Special artifact slot
  * [[en:rpd:quickslots|Quickslots]] - 4 slots for fast access items

==== Inventory Management ====
  * **Identifying Items**: Unidentified items take valuable inventory space
  * **Prioritizing**: Keep essential items like healing potions and food
  * **Selling**: [[en:rpd:shops|Shops]] allow selling items to free up space
  * **Dropping**: Unwanted items can be dropped (may be lost permanently)

==== Capacity Limits ====
  * Backpack has a fixed number of slots
  * Equipment slots are limited to specific types
  * Items that stack (like arrows, gold) share the same slot
  * Overfull inventory may force dropping important items

==== Strategy ====
  * Identify unknown potions and scrolls early to avoid dangerous effects
  * Maintain a balanced inventory with both offensive and defensive items
  * Use alchemy to convert unwanted items into useful ones
  * Store items in hero's tomb when descending if planning to return
