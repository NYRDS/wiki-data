====== Mana (Skill Points) ======

In Remixed Dungeon, the resource displayed as "Mana" in the UI is actually the **Skill Points** system. This is used for casting spells and using class abilities.

==== Description ====
Skill Points (displayed as "Mana" in the UI) is the resource used for casting spells and activating class abilities. It represents the character's energy for using magical abilities.

==== Mechanics ====
  * Skill Points regenerate passively over time through the [[en:rpd:mana_regeneration_buff|Mana Regeneration]] buff
  * Different spells and abilities consume varying amounts of skill points
  * Characters can accumulate skill points through various means:
    * Advancing to new levels
    * Being in safe areas (when not in combat)
    * Using items like [[en:rpd:potion_of_mana_item|Potion of Mana]] and [[en:rpd:mana_potion_item|Mana Potion]]
    * Special equipment that provides mana regeneration bonuses

==== Usage ====
  * Casting spells consumes skill points
  * Using class armor abilities (Special Attack) consumes skill points
  * Different heroes may have different base skill point pools and regeneration rates

==== Stats ====
  * Skill points regenerate automatically at a base rate
  * The rate can be enhanced by various buffs and equipment
  * The [[en:rpd:mana_regeneration_buff|Mana Regeneration]] buff handles the passive regeneration
  * Fast Mana Regeneration facilitation adds a +10 bonus to regeneration

==== Acquisition ====
  * Skill points are automatically gained through gameplay
  * Certain classes and subclasses may have bonuses to skill point generation or usage
  * Various items and effects can directly increase skill points
