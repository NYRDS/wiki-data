{{ rpd:images:ghost_sprite.png|Ghost NPC }}

==== Description ====
The Ghost is a non-player character (NPC) found in the sewers level of Remixed Dungeon. It is a sad spirit that is unable to move on until it completes a specific task related to retrieving an item or seeking revenge.

==== Background ====
The ghost was once an adventurer like the player but died in the dungeon and is now trapped. It asks the player for help with either retrieving a dried rose or slaying a specific monster depending on which quest variant occurs.

==== Quest Variants ====
The Ghost offers one of two possible quests:

===== Rose Quest =====
  * The ghost asks the player to find its "dried rose" which was stolen by a monster from its body after death
  * Completing this quest rewards the player with special items

===== Revenge Quest =====
  * The ghost asks the player to slay the "fetid rat" that took its life
  * Completing this quest rewards the player with special items

==== Special Mechanics ====
  * **Necromancer Interaction**: For Necromancer class players, there's an additional option to "dominate" the ghost using necromancy, which changes the interaction
  * **Teleportation**: After giving its initial quest, the ghost will teleport to a random location to avoid being stuck

==== Stats ====
  * **HP**: Immune to damage (doesn't take damage from attacks)
  * **Defense**: 1000 (cannot be hit effectively)
  * **Speed**: 0.5× normal speed
  * **Immunities**: Paralysis, Stun, Roots (cannot be affected by these status effects)

==== Drops ====
  * The ghost does not normally drop items
  * Rewards are given upon completion of the quest via dialogue

==== Special Abilities ====
  * **Evasion**: Immune to all damage and attacks
  * **Flight**: Moves as if flying (immune to terrain effects)
  * **Teleportation**: Will teleport randomly when approached by other characters
