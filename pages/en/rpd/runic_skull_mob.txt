{{ rpd:images:runic_skull_mob.png|Runic Skull }}

**Runic Skulls** are special mobs that appear during the Lich boss fight in the Necropolis level. They provide various effects that make the Lich encounter more challenging.

==== Description ====
Runic Skulls are summoned by the Lich during combat and remain stationary on pedestals. The Lich activates these skulls every 5 turns, causing them to have various effects that aid the Lich in combat.

==== Types of Runic Skulls ====
  * **Red Skull:** Heals the Lich for 7% of its maximum HP per skull summoned
  * **Blue Skull:** Summons Skeletons (1 per skull summoned)
  * **Green Skull:** Creates Toxic Gas clouds in a 30-cell area per skull summoned
  * **Purple Skull:** Provides complete protection from damage to the Lich

==== Mechanics ====
  * The Lich can only activate one skull at a time
  * Skulls are positioned on pedestals when the Lich battle begins
  * The number of skulls varies with difficulty (2 on Easy, 3 on Normal, 4 on Hard+)
  * Skulls are cleared when the Lich is defeated

==== Strategy ====
  * Prioritize destroying pedestals with active skulls
  * Be aware of area effects when skulls are activated
  * Prepare for different skull effects by having appropriate defenses
