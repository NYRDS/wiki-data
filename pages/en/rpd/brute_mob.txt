Brutes are tougher, stronger versions of standard [[en:rpd:gnoll_mob|gnolls]]. They serve as heavy infantry in gnoll society and are often found in more dangerous areas of the dungeon where they serve as guards or enforcers. When severely wounded, they go berserk, inflicting even more damage to their enemies. They are sometimes found with a [[en:rpd:shielded_mob|Shielded Brute]] variant.
