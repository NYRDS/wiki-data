{{ rpd:images:item_ScrollOfUpgrade.png|Scroll of Upgrade }}

The **Scroll of Upgrade** is a type of scroll in [[en:rpd:remixed_dungeon|Remixed Dungeon]] that enhances a single item, improving its quality and effectiveness.

==== Description ====
This scroll will upgrade a single item, improving its quality. A wand will increase in power and in number of charges; a weapon will inflict more damage or find its mark more frequently; a suit of armor will deflect additional blows; the effect of a ring on its wearer will intensify. Weapons and armor will also require less strength to use, and any curses on the item will be lifted.

==== Effects ====
When used on an item, the Scroll of Upgrade:
  * Increases the item's level by +1 (e.g., +0 becomes +1, +5 becomes +6)
  * Improves the item's effectiveness (higher damage, armor, etc.)
  * Removes curses from the item
  * For weapons: increases damage, accuracy, and reduces strength requirement
  * For armor: increases blocking power and reduces strength requirement
  * For rings: intensifies the ring's effect
  * For wands: increases power and charge capacity
  * Cannot upgrade items beyond +10

==== Usage ====
The scroll can be used on:
  * [[en:rpd:weapons|Weapons]]
  * [[en:rpd:armor|Armor]]
  * [[en:rpd:rings|Rings]]
  * [[en:rpd:wands|Wands]]

==== Acquisition ====
The Scroll of Upgrade can be found in:
  * [[en:rpd:chests_mechanic|Chests]] in the dungeon
  * [[en:rpd:shops|Shops]] (occasionally available)
  * As a drop from certain enemies

==== Strategy ====
  * Best used on your current best equipment to maximize benefits
  * Generally more valuable to upgrade weapons than armor
  * For weapons, the damage increase is usually more beneficial than for armor
  * Can also be used on wands to increase their charge capacity and recharge rate
  * Prioritize upgrading your main weapon or armor piece first
  * The scroll also removes curses from items
