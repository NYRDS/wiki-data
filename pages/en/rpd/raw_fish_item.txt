{{ rpd:images:item_RawFish.png|Raw Fish }}

**Raw Fish** is a food item in Remixed Dungeon. It can be found as a drop from [[en:rpd:piranha_mob|Piranhas]] and other fish enemies. However, eating raw fish carries a significant risk.

==== Description ====
Raw fish is the carcass of a fish caught by the player. While it provides some sustenance, consuming it raw carries the risk of poisoning. The fish can be cooked or otherwise processed to improve its safety and taste.

==== Stats ====
  * **Type:** Food
  * **Stackable:** Yes
  * **Price:** 7 gold
  * **Hunger Restored:** HUNGRY (moderate amount)
  * **Risks:** Poison chance when consumed raw

==== Effects ====
When eaten raw:
  * **Poison Risk:** Applies [[en:rpd:poison_buff|Poison]] for 2×(1 to hero level) turns
  * **Taste Message:** "Fishy!"
  * **Hunger Status:** Restores to HUNGRY level

==== Processing Options ====
Raw fish can be processed in several ways:
  * **Fire:** Can be burned to create [[en:rpd:fried_fish_item|Fried Fish]]
  * **Freezing:** Can be frozen to create [[en:rpd:frozen_fish_item|Frozen Fish]]
  * **Poison:** Can be poisoned to create [[en:rpd:rotten_fish_item|Rotten Fish]]

==== Acquisition ====
  * Dropped by [[en:rpd:piranha_mob|Piranhas]] and other fish enemies
  * Occasionally found in chests in aquatic areas

==== Strategy ====
  * It's generally recommended to cook raw fish before eating to avoid the poison risk
  * If you must eat it raw, be prepared with [[en:rpd:potion_of_purity_item|Potion of Purity]] or other anti-poison measures
  * Consider preserving the raw fish until you can process it safely rather than eating it immediately
  * The poison risk scales with your level, making it more dangerous at higher levels
