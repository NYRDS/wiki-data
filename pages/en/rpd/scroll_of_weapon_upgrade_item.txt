{{ rpd:images:scroll_upgrade_weapon.png|Scroll of Weapon Upgrade }}

**Scroll of Weapon Upgrade** is a type of scroll in Remixed Dungeon that enhances weapons with both an upgrade and a random enchantment.

==== Effects ====
  * **Upgrade**: Adds +1 to the weapon's level (improving damage)
  * **Enchantment**: Adds a random enchantment to the weapon
  * **Curse Removal**: Removes any curses from the weapon
  * **Badge**: Grants the "Item Level Acquired" badge when used

==== Usage ====
  * Use the scroll to select a weapon in your inventory
  * The selected weapon will be upgraded by +1 level
  * A random enchantment will be applied to the weapon (if none exists)
  * If the weapon already has an enchantment, the enchantment may be changed or preserved depending on game mechanics

==== Acquisition ====
  * Found in the dungeon at various levels
  * More common in deeper levels
  * Available in shops for purchase
  * Dropped by certain enemies
  * Sometimes found in special containers

==== Strategy ====
  * Best used on your main weapon or a weapon you plan to use for a while
  * Consider the potential enchantment when deciding which weapon to upgrade
  * Upgrading removes curses, making it useful for cursed weapons
  * Higher-level weapons have increased strength requirements, so ensure you can wield the upgraded weapon
