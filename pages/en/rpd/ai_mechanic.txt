====== AI (Artificial Intelligence) ======

AI in Remixed Dungeon refers to the artificial intelligence controlling various entities in the game, particularly mobs and NPCs.

==== Mob AI Types ====
  * **Wandering**: Mobs that wander randomly around the dungeon until they detect a player
  * **Hunting**: Mobs that actively seek out and pursue the player once detected
  * **Guard**: Mobs that stay in a specific location or patrol a set area
  * **Passive**: Mobs that won't attack the player unless provoked
  * **Specialized**: Mobs with unique behaviors (like Tengu's special tactics phase)

==== AI Behaviors ====
  * **Line of Sight**: Mobs detect players based on sight, which can be blocked by walls
  * **Sound-based Detection**: Some mobs may detect players by sound
  * **Pathfinding**: Mobs use pathfinding algorithms to navigate through the dungeon
  * **Tactical Decision Making**: Some mobs make tactical choices based on their health, the player's health, and environmental factors

==== Common AI Patterns ====
  * **Alert Phase**: Mobs become alert when they detect the player
  * **Fighting Phase**: Mobs engage in combat once close enough to the player
  * **Fleeing**: Some mobs may flee when their health is low
  * **Retaliation**: Mobs respond to attacks from the player or other sources

==== Modding AI ====
  * AI behaviors can be customized through Java code or Lua scripts for modding purposes
  * Custom AI can be implemented in both Java and Lua
