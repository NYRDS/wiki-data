====== Barrel ======

{{ rpd:images:barrel_level_object.png|Barrel }}

==== Description ====
Barrels are environmental objects found throughout the dungeon. They are wooden containers that can be pushed by the player. When ignited or impacted, they explode and create a pool of fire in the surrounding area.

==== Properties ====
  * **Flammable**: Barrels can catch fire and explode
  * **Pushable**: Can be moved by the player and some NPCs
  * **Destructible**: Destroyed when ignited or impacted
  * **Explosive**: Creates fire in adjacent cells when destroyed

==== Effects ====
When a barrel is ignited or impacted:
  * The barrel is destroyed
  * An explosion occurs at the location
  * Fire spreads to adjacent cells (8-directional)
  * Damage is dealt to characters in the area

==== Strategy ====
  * Barrels can be used strategically to create fire barriers
  * They're effective against groups of enemies when ignited
  * Can be pushed to block passages or create pathways
  * During Halloween events, some barrels transform into pumpkins with similar properties but increased danger
