====== Combat ======

Combat mechanics govern how battles work in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Description ====
Combat in Remixed Dungeon is turn-based and involves strategic positioning, proper equipment, and timing. Both the hero and enemies take turns performing actions based on their speed.

==== Combat Basics ====
  * **Turn-Based System**: Actions take time, enemies respond to the time consumed
  * **Melee Combat**: Attacking adjacent enemies
  * **Ranged Combat**: Using weapons or magic at a distance
  * **Defensive Actions**: Dodging, blocking, and evading attacks

==== Combat Stats ====
  * **Attack Skill**: Determines chance to hit in combat
  * **Defense Skill**: Determines chance to dodge attacks
  * **Damage**: Amount of damage dealt per successful attack
  * **Armor**: Reduces damage taken from physical attacks
  * **Evasion**: Chance to completely avoid attacks
  * **Accuracy**: Chance to successfully hit target

==== Combat Mechanics ====
  * **Hit Chance**: Calculated as Attack Skill / (Attack Skill + Defense Skill)
  * **Damage Calculation**: Weapon damage range with possible enhancements
  * **Armor Mitigation**: Armor reduces incoming damage by a percentage
  * **Critical Hits**: Possible for extra damage under certain conditions
  * **Positioning**: Important for melee vs ranged combat

==== Combat Strategies ====
  * **Corridor Fighting**: Use narrow spaces to fight one enemy at a time
  * **Ranged Combat**: Attack from a distance to avoid retaliation
  * **Kiting**: Move after attacking to avoid enemy retaliation
  * **Environmental Use**: Use traps, fire, and other terrain features to advantage
