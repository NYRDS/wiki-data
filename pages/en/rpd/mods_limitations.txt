====== Modding Possibilities and Limitations ======

This guide explains what can be achieved through modding in Remixed Dungeon and what limitations exist. Understanding these boundaries helps modders plan their projects effectively.

===== What CAN be done without Java code changes =====

==== Resource Overrides ====
  * **Sprites and Graphics** - Replace any game sprites completely
  * **Sounds and Music** - Change all sound effects and background music
  * **Texts and Localization** - Modify all texts and add new languages

==== JSON Configuration ====
  * **Item Properties** - Stats, appearance, behavior of all items
  * **Mob Properties** - Stats, AI, drops, abilities of all creatures
  * **Dungeon Structure** - Level connections, room types, layout
  * **Level Content** - What mobs, items and features appear where
  * **Hero Properties** - Starting equipment, stats, abilities
  * **Spells and Abilities** - Custom spell mechanics
  * **Buffs and Effects** - Status effects and their properties
  * **UI Texts** - All in-game texts and descriptions
  * **Animations** - Custom animation sequences

==== Lua Scripts ====
  * **Custom Traps** - Create completely new trap mechanics
  * **Custom Level Actors** - Add new environmental elements
  * **Custom Mobs** - Design new creatures with unique behaviors
  * **Custom Spells** - Implement new magical abilities
  * **Custom Items** - Create items with unique effects
  * **Custom Buffs** - Add new status effects
  * **Custom AI** - Implement specialized AI for mobs and NPCs
  * **Game Logic** - Modify certain game mechanics

==== Map Creation ====
  * **Pre-designed Levels** - Create completely custom levels using [[tiled]]
  * **Random Level Patterns** - Define new types of random levels
  * **Dungeon Layout** - Change how levels connect
  * **Special Areas** - Add unique branches and rooms

===== What CAN be done with Java modding (advanced) =====

==== Custom Classes ====
  * **New Item Types** - Complete new item classes with complex mechanics
  * **New Mob Types** - Completely new creatures with advanced AI
  * **New Game Systems** - Add entirely new mechanics to the game
  * **UI Extensions** - Create complex new UI systems
  * **Game State Extensions** - Add new persistent game data

==== Platform Integration ====
  * **Platform Services** - Integrate with platform-specific services
  * **Storage Extensions** - Custom data storage methods
  * **Input Handling** - New input methods or controls

===== What CANNOT be easily changed =====

==== Core Game Systems ====
  * **Inventory Size** - Fixed at 11 slots (8 equipment + 3 backpack)
  * **Level Progression** - Still follows 1-26 progression
  * **Core Game Rules** - Basic combat, movement, and survival mechanics
  * **Save System Structure** - Game state serialization is fixed
  * **Screen Resolution** - Game is designed for specific aspect ratios

==== Technical Limitations ====
  * **Game Speed** - Turn-based system cannot be made real-time
  * **Physics System** - No physics engine for complex interactions
  * **3D Graphics** - Game is strictly 2D with isometric sprites
  * **Multiplayer Support** - Single-player only, no networking
  * **Online Features** - No online functionality available

==== UI Limitations ====
  * **Main UI Layout** - Core interface positions are fixed
  * **Button Limitations** - Touch interface has limited button space
  * **Font Support** - Only specific font rendering system
  * **Window Management** - Modal windows only, no overlapping UI

==== Performance Constraints ====
  * **Mobile Performance** - Complex mods may impact performance
  * **Memory Usage** - Large resource files require more memory
  * **Loading Times** - Complex initialization can slow loading

===== Workarounds and Alternatives =====

==== For Inventory Limits ====
  * Use containers and chest-based storage
  * Implement item conversion mechanisms
  * Create storage items with internal space

==== For UI Limitations ====
  * Use scrollable interfaces within existing windows
  * Create multiple screens instead of complex overlays
  * Use iconography to convey complex information

==== For Game System Limits ====
  * Use Lua scripts to modify game behavior within the available hooks
  * Create alternative mechanics using existing systems
  * Use multiple levels to simulate new systems

===== Platform-Specific Considerations =====

==== Android ====
  * File storage follows scoped storage requirements on newer versions
  * Some mods may conflict with app updates
  * Performance may vary across devices

==== Desktop ====
  * More memory and processing power available
  * Keyboard and mouse support
  * Easier debugging and mod installation

==== Modding Capabilities vs Complexity ====

==== Beginner Level ====
  * Resource swaps (graphics, sounds, text)
  * Simple JSON modifications
  * Basic Lua scripts

==== Intermediate Level ====
  * Complex Lua scripts
  * Custom level creation
  * Advanced JSON configurations

==== Advanced Level ====
  * Java code modifications
  * Platform-specific features
  * Complex UI implementations

Understanding these possibilities and limitations helps set realistic expectations for mod projects and plan development accordingly.
