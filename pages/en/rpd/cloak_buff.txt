{{ rpd:images:cloak_buff_icon.png|Cloak Buff }}

**Cloak Buff** is a status effect in Remixed Pixel Dungeon that provides temporary invisibility. It's applied by the [[en:rpd:cloak_spell|Cloak Spell]].

==== Description ====
The **Cloak Buff** renders the affected character invisible to enemies, greatly reducing the chances of being detected. This buff is essential for stealth-based gameplay, especially for the [[en:rpd:rogue_class|Rogue]] and related subclasses.

==== Effects ====
  * **Invisibility**: Makes the character invisible to enemies (shown as "INVISIBLE" status)
  * **Stealth Bonus**: Provides a stealth bonus calculated as: Caster's skill level + caster's level / 4
  * **Duration**: Lasts for a specific duration based on the caster's skill level (caster's skill level * 5 turns)
  * **Automatic Expiration**: The buff detaches automatically when it expires

==== Mechanics ====
  * Character appears with invisible status effect
  * Cannot be applied if the caster has visible enemies nearby
  * The invisibility automatically expires after the duration period
  * The spell has a cooldown of 20 turns

==== Classes ====
  * [[en:rpd:rogue_class|Rogue]] - Primary class that benefits from this buff
  * [[en:rpd:assassin_subclass|Assassin]] - May have enhanced use of stealth mechanics
  * Other classes that can access [[en:rpd:cloak_spell|Cloak Spell]]

==== Strategy ====
  * Use when no enemies are in sight to avoid triggering the failure message
  * Plan movement carefully as the invisibility has a limited duration
  * Use to escape from groups of enemies or dangerous areas
  * Combine with other stealth-based strategies for maximum utility
  * The spell has a significant cooldown, so use it strategically
