{{ rpd:images:gnoll_hero.png|Gnoll Class Sprite }}

The **Gnoll** is one of the starting [[en:rpd:hero_class|hero classes]] in Remixed Dungeon. The Gnoll is an unconventional class that plays very differently from the traditional hero classes, with unique restrictions and abilities.

==== Description ====
The Gnoll is a class with unique mechanics that differentiates itself from other classes. It has both advantages and restrictions that make it a unique playstyle. The Gnoll is not available from the start and must be unlocked by healing a Gnoll Brute NPC in the prison or by making a donation.

==== Starting Equipment ====
  * [[en:rpd:gnoll_tomahawk|Gnoll Tomahawk]]
  * [[en:rpd:dart_item|Dart]] x8
  * [[en:rpd:roar_spell|Roar Spell]]
  * No starting armor (begins with NoArmor)
  * [[en:rpd:food_ration|Ration of Food]]
  * 20 [[en:rpd:gold_item|Gold Coins]]

==== Stats ====
  * **Starting Strength:** 15 (higher than other classes)
  * **Starting HP:** 5 (much lower than other classes)
  * **Starting SP:** 10 (standard)
  * **Max Inventory:** 19 slots

==== Special Abilities ====
  * **High Strength:** Starts with significantly higher strength than other classes, allowing use of heavy equipment
  * **Low HP:** Has much lower starting HP than other classes, requiring careful play
  * **No Starting Armor:** Begins without armor, making the Gnoll initially vulnerable
  * **Magic Affinity:** Witchcraft magic affinity, allowing access to unique spells
  * **Friendly Mobs:** Certain mob types are neutral or friendly to the Gnoll
  * **Forbidden Actions:** Cannot read certain scrolls or use certain items (like Scrolls of Read, Tomes of Mastery, Arcane Stylus)

==== Subclasses ====
The Gnoll can choose between two Mastery paths after defeating Tengu (boss #2) with a [[en:rpd:tome_of_mastery_item|Tome of Mastery]] or other special means:
  * [[en:rpd:guardian_subclass|Guardian]]
  * [[en:rpd:witch_doctor_subclass|Witch Doctor]]

==== Advantages ====
  * Very high starting strength for equipment use
  * Can use heavy weapons effectively from the beginning
  * Some mobs are friendly or neutral
  * Unique playstyle experience

==== Disadvantages ====
  * Much lower starting HP than other classes

==== Strategy ====
  * Find armor quickly due to starting without any
  * Leverage high strength to use powerful equipment early
  * Be aware of the class restrictions on certain item usage
  * Use the ability to avoid combat with friendly mobs
  * Take advantage of the Witchcraft magic affinity for spells
  * Play cautiously due to low HP pool
