{{ rpd:images:regrowth_mechanic.png|Regrowth Mechanic }}

**Regrowth** is a mechanic in Remixed Dungeon that allows certain plants to grow or regenerate in specific areas of the dungeon when watered or under certain conditions.

==== Description ====
The regrowth mechanic involves special plants and seeds that can be planted in certain areas of the dungeon and will grow over time when watered by the player. This system allows for farming of items and resources throughout dungeon exploration.

==== How Regrowth Works ====
  * Seeds can be planted on specific terrain (usually soil/dirt tiles)
  * Plants require watering to grow (using water sources like potions or wells)
  * Different seeds grow into different types of plants with various effects
  * Fully grown plants can be harvested for their useful items or effects

==== Seeds and Plants ====
  * [[en:rpd:firebloom_seed|Firebloom Seed]] - Grows into Firebloom plant that deals fire damage
  * [[en:rpd:icecap_seed|Icecap Seed]] - Grows into Icecap plant that causes chilling effects
  * [[en:rpd:sorrowmoss_seed|Sorrowmoss Seed]] - Grows into Sorrowmoss plant that poisons enemies
  * [[en:rpd:sungrass_seed|Sungrass Seed]] - Grows into Sungrass plant that provides healing
  * [[en:rpd:fadeleaf_seed|Fadeleaf Seed]] - Grows into Fadeleaf plant that provides invisibility
  * [[en:rpd:dreamweed_seed|Dreamweed Seed]] - Grows into Dreamweed plant that causes sleep
  * [[en:rpd:rotberry_seed|Rotberry Seed]] - Grows into Rotberry plant that creates a heart

==== Strategy ====
  * Carry water sources (potion of liquid flame, water from wells, etc.) to water plants
  * Plant seeds in safe, defensible positions where enemies can be drawn
  * Some plants can be used to clear rooms or deal damage to groups of enemies
  * Time management is important - allow enough time for plants to grow before harvesting
  * Some plants provide beneficial effects for the player (healing, invisibility)
