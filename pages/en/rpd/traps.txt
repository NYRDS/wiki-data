====== Traps ======

Information about traps in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Trap Types ====
Traps are hidden dangers throughout the dungeon that activate when stepped on or triggered. Common trap types include:

  * **Fire Trap** - Creates a fire explosion that burns the triggering character
  * **Poison Trap** - Releases poison gas that poisons the triggering character
  * **Paralytic Gas Trap** - Releases gas that paralyzes the triggering character
  * **Toxic Gas Trap** - Releases toxic gas that damages the triggering character over time
  * **Alarm Trap** - Creates a loud noise that alerts all enemies in the vicinity
  * **Lightning Trap** - Strikes the triggering character with lightning
  * **Gripping Trap** - Grips the triggering character and deals damage over time
  * **Burning Trap** - Burns the floor where it triggers, causing ongoing damage
  * **Rockfall Trap** - Causes rocks to fall, damaging all characters in adjacent cells

==== Trap Detection ====
  * Traps can be detected by stepping adjacent to them
  * Some items, like [[en:rpd:ring_of_detection_item|Ring of Detection]], can reveal traps without searching
  * Characters with high [[en:rpd:search|Search]] skill have better chances of detecting traps
  * [[en:rpd:hero|Heroes]] with high search skill will automatically detect nearby traps

==== Trap Disarming ====
  * Traps can be disarmed by characters with sufficient [[en:rpd:search|Search]] skill
  * Disarming traps safely requires a [[en:rpd:thief_class|Thief]] or high search stats
  * Disarming can yield materials or treasure in some cases

==== Strategy ====
  * Walk carefully and search around if you suspect traps
  * Use thrown weapons or other items to trigger traps safely
  * Some classes and items make dealing with traps safer
  * [[en:rpd:ring_of_detection_item|Ring of Detection]] is valuable for avoiding trap damage
  * Carry items that can help with status effects (poison, paralysis, etc.)
