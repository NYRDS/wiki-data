====== Damage ======

**Damage** in Remixed Dungeon represents the harm dealt by attacks to characters' health. Understanding how damage is calculated is crucial for effective gameplay.

==== Damage Types ====
  * **Physical Damage**: Standard damage reduced by armor
  * **Magical Damage**: Bypasses some physical defenses
  * **Elemental Damage**: Fire, ice, poison, etc., with different effects
  * **Direct Damage**: Damage that ignores armor and other defenses

==== Damage Calculation ====
  * **Base Weapon Damage**: The minimum and maximum damage values of the attacking weapon
  * **Armor Reduction**: Physical damage is reduced by the target's Defense Rating (DR)
  * **Random Factor**: Damage dealt is a random value between minimum and maximum damage
  * **Critical Hits**: Occasional attacks that deal increased damage
  * **Status Effects**: Buffs/debuffs can modify damage dealt or received

==== Factors Affecting Damage ====
  * **Weapon Strength**: Higher-level weapons generally deal more damage
  * **Hero Strength**: Some weapons scale with hero's strength stat
  * **Weapon Enchantments**: Special properties that can modify damage
  * **Armor**: Reduces incoming physical damage
  * **Distance**: Some ranged attacks have damage penalties at range
  * **Status Effects**: Various buffs and debuffs can affect damage output
  * **Upgrades**: Enhanced weapons and armor provide better damage statistics
