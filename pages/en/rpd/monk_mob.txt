**Monk** is a human mob found in the Prison level of Remixed Dungeon. It's a fast melee combatant that can knock your weapon out of your hands during combat.

  * **Accuracy**: 15 (base)
  * **Evasion**: 18
  * **Damage**: 8-14

==== Special Abilities ====
  * **Disarm**: When attacking the Monk, there's a chance it will knock your weapon out of your hands, forcing you to use fists
  * **High Evasion**: Very hard to hit due to high evasion stats
  * **Fast Movement**: Moves much faster than most other enemies
  * **Normal Damage**: Deals normal physical damage (not magical or elemental)

==== Strategy ====
  * Use ranged weapons or spells to avoid its disarm ability
  * Wear armor with high defense to reduce damage from its attacks
  * Be cautious when fighting in narrow corridors where you can't avoid its attacks
  * If disarmed, try to retrieve your weapon quickly or switch to a different weapon
  * Use weapons with enchantments that trigger on hit to deal damage despite its high evasion
