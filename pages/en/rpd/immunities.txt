====== Immunities ======

{{ rpd:images:gases_immunity_buff.png|Immunity Buff }}

Immunities in Remixed Dungeon represent complete protection against specific types of attacks or status effects. When a character has immunity to a particular effect, they cannot be affected by it at all.

==== Damage Immunities ====
  * **Poison Immunity**: Completely prevents poison damage
  * **Bleeding Immunity**: Completely prevents bleeding damage
  * **Fire Immunity**: Completely prevents fire damage and burning effects
  * **Paralysis Immunity**: Completely prevents paralysis effects
  * **Frost Immunity**: Completely prevents freezing and cold damage

==== Status Effect Immunities ====
  * **Sleep Immunity**: Cannot be put to sleep
  * **Charm Immunity**: Cannot be charmed by enemy abilities
  * **Terror/Fear Immunity**: Cannot be affected by fear-based effects
  * **Amok Immunity**: Cannot be driven into a rage by Amok effects
  * **Invisibility Immunity**: Cannot be made invisible (relevant for some mechanics that depend on being visible)

==== Sources of Immunity ====
  * **Innate Mob Abilities**: Some mobs have immunities as core mechanics (e.g., AirElemental and Bleeding)
  * **Buffs**: Temporary effects that grant immunity
  * **Items**: Some artifacts or items grant temporary immunities
  * **Enchantments**: Certain equipment enchantments may provide immunities

==== Immunities vs. Resistances ====
  * Immunities provide complete protection against an effect
  * Resistances reduce the effectiveness of an effect but don't eliminate it entirely
  * Some effects may have both resistance and immunity tiers
