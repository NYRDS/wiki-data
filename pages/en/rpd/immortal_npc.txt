====== Immortal NPC ======

==== Description ====
ImmortalNPC is an abstract class that extends the base NPC class in Remixed Dungeon. NPCs that inherit from this class have special properties that make them essentially invulnerable to damage and unable to move.

==== Properties ====
  * **Immobile**: Cannot move (movable = false)
  * **Invulnerable**: Cannot take damage from any attacks
  * **High Defense**: Defense skill is set to 1000 (effectively impossible to hit)
  * **Low Speed**: Speed is set to 0.5f (slower than normal)
  * **Buff Immunity**: Cannot receive or be affected by buffs
  * **Defensive**: Uses "wails" as its defense verb
  * **Reset Behavior**: Automatically resets position after actions
