==== Description ====
The Shield buff provides temporary damage absorption, protecting the character from a certain amount of incoming damage. The shield will absorb damage up to its capacity before disappearing.

==== Effects ====
  * Absorbs incoming damage up to a specific capacity
  * Reduces the damage the character would otherwise take
  * Once the total absorbed damage reaches the shield's capacity, the buff expires

==== Duration ====
  * The duration of the Shield buff varies depending on the source that applied it
  * The effect ends when the shield's absorption capacity is fully used

==== Sources ====
  * Potions of Shield can grant this effect
  * Some equipment may provide this buff under certain conditions
  * Various spells and abilities in the game may grant shield protection

==== Mechanics ====
  * The shield absorbs damage before it reaches the character's health
  * Damage exceeding the remaining shield capacity will damage the character normally
  * The shield's remaining capacity is typically visible in the buff display
