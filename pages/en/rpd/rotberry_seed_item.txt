==== Description ====
The **Rotberry Seed** is a special seed that can be planted to grow a [[en:rpd:rotberry_level_object|Rotberry]] plant. These seeds are typically obtained by activating a fully-grown Rotberry plant in the dungeon.

==== Usage ====
  * Can be planted on any soil tile
  * Takes time to grow into a full Rotberry plant
  * The resulting plant will eventually produce toxic effects when activated

==== Acquisition ====
  * Dropped by activated Rotberry plants in the dungeon
  * Can occasionally be found as loot in some chests

==== Effects When Plant Grows ====
  * When the Rotberry plant fully matures, it will generate toxic gas
  * Activating the plant also causes a temporary root effect on the character
  * More seeds are produced when the plant is activated
