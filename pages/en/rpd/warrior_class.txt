{{ rpd:images:warrior_hero.png|Warrior Class }}

The **Warrior** is one of the starting [[en:rpd:hero_classes|hero classes]] in Remixed Dungeon. The Warrior is a melee-focused class that specializes in the use of weapons and armor to tackle enemies head-on.

==== Description ====
The Warrior is a classic melee fighter who starts with a unique short sword that can be later upgraded and a small health bonus. The class is designed for direct combat and is often considered the most beginner-friendly class due to its straightforward approach to combat and good survivability.

==== Starting Equipment ====
  * [[en:rpd:short_sword_item|Short Sword]] +1 (unique, cannot be another copy)
  * [[en:rpd:ration_item|Ration of Food]]
  * [[en:rpd:potion_of_strength_item|Potion of Strength]]
  * [[en:rpd:body_armor_spell|Body Armor Spell]] (in quickslot)
  * 100 [[en:rpd:gold_item|Gold Coins]]
  * [[en:rpd:cloth_armor_item|Cloth Armor]] (identified)

==== Stats ====
  * **Starting Strength:** 11 (vs 10 for other classes)
  * **Starting HP:** 20 (vs 15 for most other classes)
  * **Starting SP:** 10 (standard)
  * **Max Inventory:** 19 slots
  * **Magic Affinity:** Combat

==== Special Abilities ====
  * **Starting Weapon:** The Warrior starts with a Short Sword +1 (identified), which can be upgraded with scrolls.
  * **Starting Buff:** Warriors begin with a small strength advantage which allows them to equip heavier weapons and armor earlier than other classes.
  * **Magic Affinity:** Combat magic affinity, allowing access to combat spells like [[en:rpd:body_armor_spell|Body Armor]], [[en:rpd:smash_spell|Smash]], [[en:rpd:die_hard_spell|Die Hard]], etc.
  * **Food Healing:** Any piece of food restores 5 health when eaten (not applicable if HP is already full and does not work if HP is already at maximum)
  * **Identified Potions:** Potions of Strength are identified from the beginning
  * **Higher Gold:** Starts with 100 gold (compared to 50-70 for other classes)

==== Subclasses ====
The Warrior can choose between two Mastery paths after defeating Tengu (boss #2) with a [[en:rpd:tome_of_mastery_item|Tome of Mastery]]:
  * [[en:rpd:gladiator_subclass|Gladiator]]
  * [[en:rpd:berserker_subclass|Berserker]]

==== Note about Page Naming ====
This page follows the current wiki convention for hero class pages using the `_class` suffix. If you arrived here from an old link, please note that hero class pages now use the format `class_name_class.txt` (e.g., `warrior_class.txt`, `mage_class.txt`) instead of just `class_name.txt`.

==== Advantages ====
  * Better starting HP and strength than other classes
  * Unique Short Sword provides an early combat advantage
  * Good survivability with high HP
  * Access to armor and defensive items

==== Disadvantages ====
  * Lacks ranged combat options
  * Less proficient with [[en:rpd:missile_weapons|missile weapons]] (as mentioned in strings: "Warriors are less proficient with missile weapons")
  * Relies on direct confrontation
  * No magical abilities for utility

==== Strategy ====
  * Use your HP advantage to engage enemies more aggressively
  * Focus on upgrading your unique Short Sword when possible
  * Invest in armor early for maximum protection
  * Take advantage of the higher strength to use better equipment
  * Consider your subclass choice carefully based on your playstyle
