====== Gnoll Zombie ======

{{ rpd:images:zombie_gnoll_mob.png|Gnoll Zombie }}

**Gnoll Zombie** (original code name: ZombieGnoll) is a special monster type in Remixed Dungeon, appearing exclusively on the [[en:rpd:guts|Guts]] levels (floors 26-30).

==== Description ====
A mangled, twisted body of a gnoll that no longer resembles either a hyena or humanoid. All that remains is a pile of rotting flesh and bones filled with the desire to kill and devour.

==== Features ====
  * **Revival:** Can revive after death (with a certain chance)
  * **Experience:** Grants experience when killed
  * **Location:** Appears exclusively on [[en:rpd:guts|Guts]] levels (floors 26-30)
  * **Category:** [[en:rpd:undead_mob|Undead]]

==== Tactics ====
The Gnoll Zombie is especially dangerous due to its ability to resurrect after death. This makes combat with it more challenging as it can return to life after seeming to be killed. Be sure to have means to deal with undead creatures at the ready.
