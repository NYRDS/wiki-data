{{ rpd:images:zombie_gnoll_mob.png|Zombie Gnoll }}

==== Basic Statistics ====
  * **Health:** 210 HP
  * **Attack Skill:** 25
  * **Defense Skill:** 27
  * **Damage:** 15-35
  * **Damage Reduction:** 20
  * **Experience:** 7 EXP for killing
  * **Maximum Level:** 35
  * **Loot:** Small chance (2%) for Gold
  * **Type:** Undead

==== Description ====
Twisted, broken body of a zombie gnoll no longer resembles a humanoid or a hyena. All that's left is just a pile of rotten flesh and bones filled with malicious urge to kill and consume.

==== Special Abilities ====
  * **Resurrection:** Has a 65% chance to rise from the dead when killed (unless killed by fire)
  * **Immunities:** Immune to Paralysis and Toxic Gas due to undead nature

==== Combat Strategy ====
Zombie Gnolls are particularly dangerous enemies because:
  * They have high health, damage, and defense stats
  * They can resurrect when killed (65% chance), making them difficult to permanently defeat
  * They are immune to several status effects (Paralysis, Toxic Gas)
  * Their high damage output can be threatening in close combat
  * The resurrection ability is negated if killed by fire damage

==== Location ====
Zombie Gnolls appear in the Guts levels (levels 26-30) of the dungeon, as specified in Bestiary.json. They are not found in the earlier Goo level, but rather in the deeper Guts levels.

==== Tactics ====
  * Be very careful when fighting, as they can resurrect after being killed (65% chance)
  * Use fire-based attacks to prevent resurrection when possible
  * Keep distance when possible due to their high damage output
  * Be prepared for a longer fight due to their high HP and damage reduction
