====== Range ======

Range refers to the distance at which characters can attack targets in Remixed Dungeon. Understanding range is crucial for combat effectiveness and positioning.

==== Types of Range ====
  * **Melee Range:** 1 tile (adjacent enemies only)
  * **Short Range:** 2-3 tiles (some special weapons)
  * **Long Range:** 4+ tiles (wands, some spells)

==== Range Mechanics ====
  * Most weapons have range of 1 (melee)
  * Some weapons like [[en:rpd:kusarigama_item|Kusarigama]] have extended range
  * [[en:rpd:wands|Wands]] typically have long range
  * [[en:rpd:throwing_weapons|Throwing weapons]] have varying ranges
  * Range affects targeting and line of sight requirements

==== Weapons with Extended Range ====
  * [[en:rpd:kusarigama_item|Kusarigama]] - Range 2
  * [[en:rpd:boomerang_item|Boomerang]] - Range 2-4 depending on level
  * Various [[en:rpd:throwing_weapons|throwing weapons]] - Varies by type
  * [[en:rpd:bows_crossbows_arrows|Bows]] and [[en:rpd:arrows_item|arrows]] - Range up to 8
  * [[en:rpd:shuriken_item|Shuriken]] - Range 6

==== Strategy ====
  * Extended range allows attacking enemies safely from a distance
  * Helps against enemies that prefer close combat
  * Can be useful for triggering traps from a safe distance
  * Consider line of sight when attacking at range
