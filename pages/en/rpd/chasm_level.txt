====== Chasm Level ======

==== Description ====
Chasm level is a dungeon level feeling that appears in Remixed Dungeon. This level type features chasms (pits/abysses) throughout the level, which can be dangerous for players who are pushed into them. Air Elementals are known to spawn on this type of level feeling.

==== Features ====
  * **Chasms**: The level contains numerous chasms that can cause characters to fall
  * **Air Elementals**: These flying enemies use Wind Gust to potentially push players into chasms
  * **Flying Advantage**: Flying creatures can traverse chasms safely
  * **Risk of Falling**: Players without levitation or similar protection risk falling into chasms when pushed by enemies

==== Strategy ====
  * Be cautious when fighting enemies that can push you (like Air Elementals)
  * Bring Levitation potions or spells to prevent falling
  * Avoid fighting push-capable enemies near chasms when possible
  * Consider using ranged attacks from a safe distance
