====== Strength ======

Strength determines the hero's ability to wear armor and use weapons effectively in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Description ====
Strength is a key attribute in Remixed Dungeon that determines the hero's ability to effectively use armor and weapons. If the hero's strength is insufficient for a piece of equipment, the equipment will be harder to use and less effective.

==== Strength Mechanics ====
  * **Equipment Requirement**: Each piece of armor and weapon has a strength requirement
  * **Penalties**: Using equipment with insufficient strength results in penalties
  * **Growth**: Strength can be increased using [[en:rpd:potion_of_strength_item|Potion of Strength]]
  * **Base Value**: All heroes start with 10 Strength (varies by class)

==== Equipment Strength Requirements ====
  * **Armor**: Higher tier armor requires more strength to wear effectively
  * **Weapons**: Heavier weapons require more strength for full damage
  * **Penalties**: Insufficient strength results in reduced effectiveness and slower action speeds

==== Strength Considerations ====
  * **Equipment Planning**: Plan equipment choices around current strength
  * **Potion Usage**: Save [[en:rpd:potion_of_strength_item|Potions of Strength]] for important moments
  * **Class Synergy**: Some classes require more strength than others
  * **Timing**: Strength potions might be used early to get access to better gear

==== Strength Effects ====
  * **Armor Penalty**: Wearing armor with insufficient strength reduces defense and speed
  * **Weapon Penalty**: Using weapons with insufficient strength reduces damage and speed
  * **Encumbrance**: Lower strength may reduce mobility with heavy equipment
