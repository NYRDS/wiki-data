Date: December 17, 2025

## Verification Process

Performed a comprehensive verification of the Remixed Dungeon wiki content:

1. Read the WIKI_DOCUMENTATION.md to understand the wiki system

2. Pulled and analyzed recent changes from the wiki-data submodule

3. Selected and verified random wiki pages against the codebase:
   - amok_arrow.txt: Verified accuracy of implementation details
   - sacrificial_sword_item.txt: Verified accuracy of implementation details
   - buffs.txt: Verified accuracy of implementation details
   - range.txt: Verified accuracy of implementation details
   - spirit_of_pain.txt: Verified accuracy of implementation details
4. Checked all images in wiki pages - no broken image references found

5. Checked backlinks and redlinks - identified 875 red links (mostly in Russian section)

6. Checked for duplicate content - no content duplicates found at higher thresholds

7. Verified naming patterns follow conventions (e.g., _mob, _subclass suffixes)

## Findings

  - Wiki content is generally accurate with the codebase
  - No broken image references found
  - No content duplicates requiring merging
  - Naming conventions are followed properly
  - Some red links exist as expected (for pages that are not yet created)

## Recommendations

  - Focus on creating pages for the red links, especially in the English section
  - Continue following the established naming conventions for new pages
  - Maintain consistency by referencing source code for accuracy
