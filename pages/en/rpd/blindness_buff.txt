{{ rpd:images:blindness_buff.png|Blindness Status Effect }}

**Blindness** is a status effect in Remixed Dungeon that impairs the affected character's vision, reducing their ability to navigate and fight effectively.

==== Description ====
Completely blinded, only the sounds around can be heard. The affected character experiences significant penalties to vision, accuracy, and defense.

==== Effects ====
  * **Reduced Vision**: Affected characters have limited sight range (character needs to be adjacent to hear sounds)
  * **Accuracy Penalty**: Reduced accuracy when attacking
  * **Defense Penalty**: Reduced defense against attacks
  * **Navigation**: Difficulty navigating terrain effectively
  * **Detection**: Character can only detect adjacent enemies
  * **Duration**: The effect lasts until it wears off or is cured
