{{ rpd:images:compound_bow_item.png|Compound Bow }}

==== Description ====
The Compound Bow is a powerful ranged weapon in Remixed Dungeon. It offers higher damage output and improved accuracy compared to basic bows, but at the cost of attack speed.

==== Properties ====
  * **Weapon Type**: Ranged weapon
  * **Damage**: Higher than basic bows
  * **Accuracy**: Superior to wooden bows
  * **Speed**: Slower than basic bows

==== Mechanics ====
When using the Compound Bow, arrows launched from it deal a great amount of damage and have improved accuracy over a wooden bow, but at the cost of some speed. This makes it effective for players who prefer to engage enemies from a distance with reliable damage output.
