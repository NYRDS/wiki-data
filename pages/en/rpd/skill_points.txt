====== Skill Points ======

**Skill Points** are the primary resource system in Remixed Dungeon used for casting spells and performing special abilities.

==== Description ====
Skill Points are the underlying resource system that powers spells and special abilities in Remixed Dungeon. Rather than a traditional mana system, the game uses skill points that are accumulated over time and consumed when casting spells.

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Regeneration:** Skill points regenerate passively through the [[en:rpd:mana_regeneration|Mana Regeneration]] buff
  * **Consumption:** Different spells consume different amounts of skill points when cast
  * **Accumulation:** Points accumulate gradually over time based on various factors
  * **Maximum:** Character has a maximum skill point capacity that can be increased

==== Regeneration ====
  * Regenerates 1 skill point every 20/(1.2^bonus) turns
  * Faster regeneration with bonuses from buffs and game facilitations
  * Does not regenerate in unsafe areas (when enemies are present)
  * Game facilitation ''FAST_MANA_REGENERATION'' provides +10 bonus
  * Other buffs may provide additional regeneration bonuses

==== Spell Costs ====
  * Different spells have different skill point costs
  * Examples: Cloak spell costs 5 skill points, Raise Dead costs 15 skill points
  * Cost is consumed when the spell is cast successfully
  * Some spells may fail but still consume the skill points

==== Restoration ====
  * [[en:rpd:mana_potion_item|Mana Potion]] - Restores 1/3 of max skill points when consumed
  * Some equipment or abilities may provide skill point restoration

==== Classes That Use Skill Points ====
  * All classes can use spells that consume skill points if they have access to them
  * Classes with higher spell affinity may have more efficient usage or bonuses
  * Different classes may have access to different spell types

==== Strategy ====
  * Manage skill points carefully during extended fights
  * Carry [[en:rpd:mana_potion_item|Mana Potions]] for magic-heavy sections
  * Balance offensive spells with skill point conservation
  * Consider equipment that improves skill point regeneration
  * Plan spell usage around regeneration timing
