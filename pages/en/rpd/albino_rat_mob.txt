====== Albino Rat ======

{{ rpd:images:albino_rat_mob.png|Albino Rat }}

The **Albino Rat** is a rare variant of the common [[en:rpd:rat_mob|Marsupial Rat]] found in the Sewers (levels 1-4) of Remixed Dungeon. Marsupial rats are aggressive, but rather weak denizens of the sewers. They can be dangerous only in big numbers. This particular rat seems to be an albino. It also has abnormally sharp teeth.

==== Overview ====
Albino rats are much rarer variants of the common Marsupial Rat. While still relatively weak individually, they possess a special ability that can make them significantly more dangerous than normal rats - they cause bleeding damage to their target when attacking.

==== Stats ====
  * **HP**: 15 (HT: 15) (Note: Different from base rat which has 8 HP)
  * **Defense Skill**: 3
  * **Attack Skill**: 8
  * **Damage**: 1-5 + bleed effect
  * **DR (Damage Reduction)**: 1
  * **EXP for Kill**: 1
  * **Maximum Level**: 7
  * **Attack Delay**: 1 turn
  * **View Distance**: 8 tiles

==== Abilities ====
  * **Bleeding Attack**: When the Albino Rat successfully hits the player, it has a 50% chance to inflict [[en:rpd:bleeding_buff|Bleeding]] damage equal to the original attack damage
  * **Aggressive Behavior**: Like common rats, they are aggressive but weak individually

==== Combat Tactics ====
Albino rats follow the same simple AI patterns as regular rats, moving toward the player and attacking when adjacent. However, their bleeding attack makes them more threatening than normal rats, especially if multiple hits occur in succession.

==== Occurrence ====
  * **Primary Location**: Found in Sewers level
  * **Spawn Frequency**: Rare variant
  * **Group Behavior**: Usually found alone or in small groups
  * **Variant Type**: Albino rats are the bleeding variant of the common rat

==== Strategy ====
  * Defeating them quickly is important to avoid sustained bleeding damage
  * Consider using armor or other damage reduction to minimize the bleeding effect
  * Avoid being surrounded by multiple albino rats as the bleeding damage stacks
  * Use ranged weapons or spells to pick them off from a safe distance
  * Prioritize healing if engaged in combat with multiple albino rats

==== Special Notes ====
  * Like normal rats, their death can trigger quest checks for multiple NPCs (Scarecrow, Ghost, and Plague Doctor quests)
  * The bleeding effect can stack if multiple albino rats hit repeatedly
  * Despite being rare, they're still early-game enemies suitable for low-level characters
  * They follow the same basic AI as common rats but with the added danger of bleed damage
  * Defeating an Albino Rat earns a special badge (RARE_ALBINO)
