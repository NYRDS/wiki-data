====== Caves ======

The **Caves** is a dungeon area located beneath the prison, representing the dwarven mining excavations. It's characterized by sparse population and mineral-poor environment.

==== Description ====
The caves, which stretch down under the abandoned prison, are sparsely populated. They lie too deep to be exploited by the City and they are too poor in minerals to interest the dwarves. In the past there was a trade outpost somewhere here on the route between these two states, but it has perished since the decline of the Dwarven Metropolis. Only omnipresent gnolls and subterranean animals dwell here now.
