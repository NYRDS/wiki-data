====== Glyph ======

{{ rpd:images:item_ArmorKit.png|Glyph }}

A Glyph is a special magical property that can be added to armor in Remixed Dungeon using an [[en:rpd:arcane_stylus_item|Arcane Stylus]]. Each armor piece can have only one glyph, which provides special defensive or utility abilities.

==== Common Glyphs ====
  * **Affection:** Charms enemies that attack you
  * **Antimagic:** Reduces magical damage
  * **Brimstone:** Protects from fire and provides warmth
  * **Camouflage:** Grants invisibility in high grass
  * **Entanglement:** Grows earthroot around you when attacked
  * **Flow:** Increases movement speed in water
  * **Obfuscation:** Reduces accuracy of attacks against you
  * **Potential:** Generates electricity when attacked
  * **Repulsion:** Pushes enemies away when they attack you
  * **Stone:** Makes armor heavier but more protective
  * **Swiftness:** Increases movement speed near enemies

==== Application ====
  * Applied using an [[en:rpd:arcane_stylus_item|Arcane Stylus]] (formally called Stylus in the game code) on armor
  * Process is random - you don't choose which glyph is applied
  * Once applied, the glyph cannot be removed or changed
  * Higher-level armor will have stronger glyph effects

==== Code Reference ====
  * Java Class: [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/watabou/pixeldungeon/items/Stylus.java|Stylus.java]] (Note: Called Stylus in code, not ArcaneStylus)
  * Source Code Location: RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/watabou/pixeldungeon/items/Stylus.java

==== Strategic Considerations ====
  * Choose armor to apply glyphs based on your needs and playstyle
  * Consider class synergies (e.g., Rogues benefit from stealth glyphs)
  * Some glyphs are more valuable than others depending on the dungeon level
  * Risk vs. reward: you might get a highly desirable glyph or an unhelpful one
