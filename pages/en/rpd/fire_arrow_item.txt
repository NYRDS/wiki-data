  * **Delay**: 0.75 (baseDly: 0.75)
  * **Min Strength Required**: 9

  * **Bow Enhancement**: Damage values are modified by the equipped bow's damage factor (dmgFactor()) when fired from a bow
  * **Bonus Damage**: If effective strength exceeds the required strength by more than 2 points, adds extra damage: MAX += (MIN + (effectiveSTR - requiredSTR - 2))
