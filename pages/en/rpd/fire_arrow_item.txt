{{ rpd:images:fire_arrow_item.png|Fire Arrow }}

The **Fire Arrow** is a special type of [[en:rpd:missile_weapons|missile weapon]] that causes the [[en:rpd:burning_buff|Burning]] status effect when it hits a target.

==== Description ====
A wooden arrow with a head soaked in flammable material. When this arrow hits an enemy, it ignites the target. According to the string resources, "This arrow looks just like a normal one, other than a warm red light radiating from its head."

==== Stats ====
  * **Damage**: 1-6
  * **Delay**: 0.75 (baseDly: 0.75)
  * **Min Strength Required**: 9
  * **Price**: 5 gold per arrow
  * **Weight**: 1

==== Special Abilities ====
  * **Burning Effect**: When the arrow hits a target, it applies the [[en:rpd:burning_buff|Burning]] status effect with a 25% chance when thrown from a ranged weapon
  * **Mechanism**: Uses Buff.affect(defender, [[en:rpd:burning_buff|Burning.class]]).reignite(defender) when activated - this occurs on every successful hit with a 25% probability when fired from a bow/weapon; always activates when used by enemies
  * **Bow Enhancement**: Damage values are modified by the equipped bow's damage factor (dmgFactor()) when fired from a bow
  * **Bonus Damage**: If effective strength exceeds the required strength by more than 2 points, adds extra damage: MAX += (MIN + (effectiveSTR - requiredSTR - 2))
  * **Elven Class Bonus**: When used by an Elf, accuracy is increased by 10% and delay is reduced by 10%

==== Properties ====
  * **Type:** [[en:rpd:missile_weapons|Missile Weapon]]/Ammunition (Special)
  * **Usage:** For use with ranged weapons like bows
  * **Consumable:** Each arrow is consumed after being shot
  * **Stackable:** Can stack up to very high quantities

==== Creation ====
Fire Arrows can be created by using a [[en:rpd:potion_of_liquid_flame_item|Potion of Liquid Flame]] on regular [[en:rpd:common_arrow_item|Common Arrows]]. This process is called "[[en:rpd:moisten|moistening]]" and transforms the basic arrow into one with special properties.

==== Acquisition ====
  * Can be found in various treasure locations throughout the dungeon
  * Quantity typically ranges from 15-30 when randomly generated (defined in Arrow.java random() method)
  * Found in Treasury.json and SpidersTreasury.json with probability of 2
  * **Creation:** Can be created through [[en:rpd:alchemy|alchemy]] by moistening common arrows with Potion of Liquid Flame

==== Mechanics ====
  * When hitting an enemy, applies the Burning status effect
  * Burning causes damage over time until extinguished or enemy dies
  * Can ignite flammable terrain like grass when fired into it
  * Burning enemies take damage and can set adjacent flammable terrain on fire
  * Does not stack with other status effects like Poison or Paralysis

==== Strategy ====
  * Effective against enemies vulnerable to fire damage
  * Particularly useful against groups as burning can spread to adjacent tiles
  * Good for dealing additional damage over time
  * The burning effect only occurs on a successful hit with 25% chance when thrown from a ranged weapon
  * Excellent for dealing sustained damage to groups of enemies
  * Can be used to create environmental advantages by igniting terrain
  * Be careful using in areas with flammable terrain that might spread to you
  * Effective against enemies that don't kill you immediately, allowing the fire to work
  * Good against undead and cold-based enemies which typically take extra fire damage
