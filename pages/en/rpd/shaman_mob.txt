{{ rpd:images:shaman_mob.png|Shaman Sprite }}

==== Description ====
**Shamans** are the spellcasters and leaders of gnoll society. They are less physically strong than other gnolls but make up for it with their magical abilities, particularly their mastery of lightning magic.

==== Stats ====
  * **HP**: 18
  * **HT**: 18
  * **Defense Skill**: 8
  * **Attack Skill**: 11
  * **Damage**: 2-6
  * **Armor**: 4 DR
  * **EXP for Kill**: 6
  * **Maximum Level**: 14

==== Special Abilities ====
  * **Lightning Zap**: Can cast lightning attacks from a distance using [[en:rpd:ballistica_mechanic|Ballistica]]
  * **Electricity Resistance**: Higher resistance to electrical effects (specifically to [[en:rpd:lightning_trap|LightningTrap.Electricity]] class)
  * **Retreat Behavior**: Will flee when low on health to heal and reposition
  * **Flee Mechanics**: May flee when HP is above 2/3 or 1/3 of max HP, taking only half damage during those states
  * **Vocalization**: Has a 10% chance to yell "*Cusses in gnollish*" when missing with lightning zap
  * **Lightning Proc**: On zap hit, creates chain lightning that can damage other nearby enemies

==== Notes ====
Shamans are typically found in areas where gnolls have established a more permanent presence. They are dangerous opponents due to their ranged magical attacks and should be approached carefully.

==== Combat Strategy ====
  * Approach carefully due to their [[en:rpd:ranged_combat|ranged attacks]]
  * Consider using [[en:rpd:melee_combat|melee tactics]] to close the distance quickly
  * Be wary of their [[en:rpd:electricity|electricity]]-based attacks
  * They may retreat when low on health, so finish them quickly to avoid their escape
  * Their [[en:rpd:armor_mechanic|armor]] of 4 [[en:rpd:armor_mechanic|DR]] provides moderate protection
