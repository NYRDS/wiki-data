====== Defence Skill ======

**Defence Skill** is a core game mechanic that determines a character's ability to avoid incoming attacks in combat.

==== Overview ====
Defence Skill represents a character's ability to dodge or parry attacks. It's used in the combat resolution system to determine if an attack hits or misses.

==== Calculation ====
The base defence skill is calculated based on:
  * **Hero**: Affected by [[en:rpd:armor_item|armor]] and [[en:rpd:accessories|accessories]] like [[en:rpd:ring_of_evasion_item|Ring of Evasion]]
  * **Mobs**: Each mob has a base defence skill value defined in its class

==== Combat Mechanics ====
When an attack is made, the game compares the attacker's [[en:rpd:attack_skill_mechanic|attack skill]] with the defender's defence skill. Higher defence skill makes the character harder to hit.

==== Affected Items ====
  * [[en:rpd:ring_of_evasion_item|Ring of Evasion]] - Increases defence skill by its level amount
  * [[en:rpd:armor_item|Armor]] - Provides defence bonus based on its tier and level
  * [[en:rpd:shields|Shields]] - Additional defensive items
