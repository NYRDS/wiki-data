==== Effect ====
When read, the Spell Book casts its contained spell without requiring the hero to have learned that spell or possess the required magic affinity. The specific effect depends on the spell contained within.

According to the game's string resources: "It looks more like a compilation of assorted pages that were sewed together, than an actual book. You might be able to make something out of it if you'll pay enough attention."
