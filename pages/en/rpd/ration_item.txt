{{ rpd:images:ration_item.png|Ration }}

The **Ration** (also known as Ration of Food) is the standard food item in Remixed Dungeon. All classes start with one ration in their inventory, except for the Gnoll which starts with no armor and special food items.

==== Description ====
A preserved piece of food that restores 280 hunger points. It's the standard food provided to heroes at the start of their journey.

==== Effects ====
  * **Hunger Restoration**: Restores 280 hunger points
  * **Satiety**: Provides a moderate amount of food satisfaction
  * **Nutrition**: Standard nutritional value for maintaining hero health

==== Acquisition ====
  * **Starting Item**: Most hero classes start with one ration
  * **Dungeon**: Found in various containers throughout the dungeon
  * **Shops**: Available for purchase in dungeon shops
  * **Alchemy**: Can be created using alchemy

==== Strategy ====
  * Consume when hunger is low to prevent the hunger debuff
  * Preserve rations early game when other food sources are scarce
  * Consider more efficient food items (like Pasties) when available
