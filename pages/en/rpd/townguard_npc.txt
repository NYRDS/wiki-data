{{ rpd:images:townguard_npc.png|Town Guard }}

==== Description ====
The Town Guard is a non-player character (NPC) found in the town area of Remixed Dungeon. These guards are static NPCs that provide flavor text when interacted with.

==== Behavior ====
  * **Immobile**: Town Guards cannot move (movable = false)
  * **Dialogue**: When interacted with, they show a dialogue window with one of three random messages
  * **Static positioning**: They remain in fixed positions in the town area

==== Interaction ====
When the player interacts with a Town Guard, the character will turn to face the player and display a dialogue window containing three possible messages:

  * "Move along." (Generic dismissal)
  * "Thanks to adventurers like you, it became really peaceful up here." (Gratitude for clearing the dungeon)
  * "You think there are too many guards in this town? Well, that's because this is the only town with a gigantic monster-infested dungeon, isn't it?" (Acknowledging the unusual security situation)

==== Location ====
  * Found in the [[en:rpd:town_level|Town level]]
  * Also appears in the [[en:rpd:portal_shrine_level|Portal Shrine level]]
  * Positioned in fixed locations within town areas

==== Implementation ====
  * Inherits from [[en:rpd:immortal_npc|ImmortalNPC]] class
  * Uses string resources for dialogue messages
  * Implemented as a simple dialogue display with no other functionality

==== Strategy ====
  * Town Guards are friendly NPCs that provide lore and flavor text
  * They do not provide quests or items
  * Simply interact to read their messages
