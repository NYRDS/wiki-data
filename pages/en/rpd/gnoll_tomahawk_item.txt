{{ rpd:images:gnolltamahawk_sprite.png|Gnoll Tomahawk }}

The **Gnoll Tomahawk** (//GnollTamahawk// in code) is a unique throwing weapon specifically associated with the [[en:rpd:gnoll_class|Gnoll]] playable class. It's the starting weapon for the [[en:rpd:gnoll_class|Gnoll]] class and represents their distinctive combat style.

==== Description ====
The Gnoll Tomahawk is a specialized throwing axe that represents the gnoll's native weapon. It combines the functionality of both a melee and throwing weapon, though it excels in the latter role. Created by Gnoll masters, each clan has its own unique design. This Tomahawk is slightly lighter than its counterparts. In the game code, this item is implemented as a subclass of [[en:rpd:tomahawk_item|Tomahawk]] with specific differences.

==== Stats ====
  * **Damage:** 3-17 points (from code: MIN=3, MAX=17)
  * **Strength Required:** 15 (from code: setSTR(15))
  * **Durability:** Normal (does not break when thrown)
  * **Speed:** 1.0x (inherits base weapon speed)
  * **Accuracy:** 1.0x (inherits base accuracy)
  * **Image:** Randomly selected from 8 different sprites (from code: Random.Int(0,8))

==== Properties ====
  * **Type:** Throwing/melee weapon (inherits from [[en:rpd:tomahawk_item|Tomahawk]])
  * **Class:** [[en:rpd:gnoll_class|Gnoll]] (specific starting weapon)
  * **Base Damage:** Moderate to high for early game
  * **Durability:** Unlike regular [[en:rpd:tomahawk_item|Tomahawks]], does not break when thrown at a target
  * **Accuracy:** High accuracy when thrown
  * **Upgradable:** Yes, can be upgraded with Scrolls of Upgrade (from code: isUpgradable() returns true)

==== Special Properties ====
  * Unique starting weapon for the [[en:rpd:gnoll_class|Gnoll]] class
  * Thrown weapon with good range
  * Unlike regular [[en:rpd:tomahawk_item|Tomahawks]], does not break when thrown at a target (from code: onThrow method implementation)
  * Can be used in melee combat (from code: notUsableInMelee() returns false)
  * Each copy has one of 8 randomly selected images (from code: imageIndex = Random.Int(0,8))

==== Special Features ====
  * **Dual Functionality:** Can be used for both throwing and melee combat (unlike regular Tomahawks which are throwing-only)
  * **Starting Equipment:** Exclusive to the [[en:rpd:gnoll_class|Gnoll]] class
  * **Durability:** Unlike regular Tomahawks, doesn't break when thrown
  * **Melee Capability:** Returns false for notUsableInMelee(), meaning it can be used in melee combat

==== Combat Usage ====
  * **Ranged:** Effective at range when thrown
  * **Melee:** Can be used in close combat if needed (unlike regular Tomahawks)
  * **Damage:** Good damage output for its level (3-17 vs 4-20 of regular Tomahawk)
  * **Str Requirement:** Lower STR requirement (15 vs 17 of regular Tomahawk)

==== Implementation ====
  * Extends the [[en:rpd:tomahawk_item|Tomahawk]] class with modified stats and behavior
  * Overrides onThrow() method for custom throwing behavior
  * Overrides notUsableInMelee() to return false (allowing melee use)
  * Overrides isUpgradable() to return true
  * Random image selection from 8 different sprites

==== Notes ====
The Gnoll Tomahawk is the signature weapon of the [[en:rpd:gnoll_class|Gnoll]] class, providing a powerful ranged option for these hyena-like warriors. Unlike the regular Tomahawk, it doesn't break when thrown and can be used in melee combat, making it a versatile weapon for the Gnoll class.
