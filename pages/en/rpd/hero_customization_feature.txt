====== Hero Customization Feature ======

The **Hero Customization** feature allows players to customize their hero's appearance including gender, skin color, and other visual attributes.

====== Gender Customization ======

The gender customization system uses a layered approach:

  * **Underwear Layer**: underwear_gender (man, woman, none)
  * **Body Layer**: bodies (man, woman) -> human (everyone naked)

====== Skin Color Customization ======

Skin color customization involves multiple body part variations:

  * **Bodies**: human -> human_[white,black,brown,yellow, etc]
  * **Gnoll Bodies**: gnoll -> gnoll_[brown, pink, violet, etc]
  * **Heads**: head_class_subclass -> head_race_skinColor (no hairs at all on heads)
  * **Hands**: class_animation -> race_skinColor_animation

Alternatively, palette remapping can be used to define color variations from the current skin tone.

====== Implementation Notes ======

This feature is planned for future implementation to provide more diverse hero representation in the game.
