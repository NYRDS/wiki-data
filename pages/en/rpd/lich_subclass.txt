====== Lich Subclass ======

{{ rpd:images:necromancer_lich_hero.png|Lich Hero }}

The **Lich** is a hero subclass available to the [[en:rpd:necromancer_class|Necromancer]] class. It represents the pinnacle of necromantic power, where the hero has transcended life and death.

==== Description ====
The _Lich_ is a necromancer who reached the pinnacle of his abilities. Existing between life and death, the Lich excels in necromancy, but his combat skills are greatly lower than those of an ordinary person. When a Necromancer achieves this form, their powers grow and their soul capacity is doubled, but they lose strength points.

==== Special Properties ====
  * **Immunities:** The Lich has immunity to Paralysis, ToxicGas, Terror, Death, Amok, Blindness, Sleep, Poison, Vertigo, and Bleeding (as defined in [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/assets/hero/initHeroes.json#L69-L79|initHeroes.json]])
  * **Souls:** Maximum soul capacity (skill points) is doubled compared to the standard Necromancer (as defined in [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/watabou/pixeldungeon/actors/hero/Hero.java#L486-L488|Hero.java]] where soul points are accumulated)
  * **Special Armor:** Gains the [[en:rpd:necromancer_armor_item|NecromancerArmor]] upon becoming a Lich
  * **Reduced Strength:** Loses strength points upon transformation

==== Unlocking ====
The Lich subclass can be unlocked using the [[en:rpd:black_skull_of_mastery_item|Black Skull of Mastery]] after reaching sufficient mastery in necromancy.

==== Strategy ====
The Lich subclass is optimal for players who want to maximize their necromantic abilities and undead summoning capabilities. The immunities make the Lich more resilient to status effects that would otherwise hamper a standard Necromancer. However, the loss of strength and reduced combat abilities require focusing on necromantic abilities and summoning undead minions to fight on your behalf.
