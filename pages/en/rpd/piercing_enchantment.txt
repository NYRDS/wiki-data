====== Piercing Enchantment ======

{{ rpd:images:enchant_piercing.png|Piercing Enchantment }}

==== Description ====
The Piercing enchantment allows attacks to damage multiple enemies in a straight line. When hitting an enemy, the attack can continue through them to hit other enemies in the same direction, dealing reduced damage to each subsequent target.

==== Mechanics ====
  - On a successful hit, the damage can continue through the target in a straight line
  - Each subsequent target receives reduced damage compared to the previous one
  - The damage reduction is calculated as: maxDamage = (int)(damage * Math.pow(2, -1d / (level + 1)))
  - Can potentially hit multiple enemies in the same direction until the damage falls below 1 or the edge of the level is reached
  - Damage dealt to subsequent targets uses the same damage calculation as the original hit

==== Technical Details ====
  - The damage reduction is based on the weapon's level
  - Higher-level weapons maintain more of the original damage when piercing
  - The line of effect continues until it reaches the edge of the level or encounters no more targets
  - The effect is limited by a minimum damage threshold (below 1 damage prevents further piercing)

==== Source Code ====
  - Java: [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/watabou/pixeldungeon/items/weapon/enchantments/Piercing.java|Piercing.java]]
  - The effect applies damage to enemies in a straight line continuation from the initial target
  - The direction is calculated as: direction = target_pos - attacker_pos
