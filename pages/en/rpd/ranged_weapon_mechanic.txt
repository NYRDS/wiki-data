====== Ranged Weapon Mechanics ======

Ranged weapons in Remixed Dungeon follow specific mechanics that govern how they function, including ammunition requirements, accuracy, and special properties.

==== Properties ====
  * **Damage**: The minimum and maximum damage values the weapon can deal
  * **Delay**: The time needed to perform an attack with this weapon
  * **Accuracy**: How likely the weapon is to hit its target at range
  * **Strength**: The minimum strength required to use the weapon effectively
  * **Ammunition**: Most ranged weapons require specific ammunition to function

==== Ammunition System ====
Ranged weapons use an [[en:rpd:ammunition|ammunition]] system that requires specific types of projectiles:
  * **Bows** require [[en:rpd:arrow_item|Arrows]]
  * **Crossbows** require [[en:rpd:bolt_item|Bolts]]
  * **Dart Throwers** require [[en:rpd:dart_item|Darts]]
  * **Wands** use charges instead of physical ammunition

==== Accuracy and Range ====
Ranged weapons have different accuracy based on distance:
  * **Close range** (1-2 tiles): 100% accuracy
  * **Medium range** (3-4 tiles): 80% accuracy
  * **Long range** (5+ tiles): 60% accuracy, with additional penalty for each additional tile

==== Special Effects ====
Some ranged weapons have special properties when used:
  * **Wands** can have unique magical effects based on their type
  * **Enhanced ranged weapons** with [[en:rpd:enchantments|enchantments]] may have additional effects
  * **Throwing weapons** may break after use depending on their durability

==== Weapon Types ====
  * [[en:rpd:bow_item|Bows]] - Traditional projectile weapons requiring arrows
  * [[en:rpd:crossbow_item|Crossbows]] - Powerful ranged weapons with slower fire rate
  * [[en:rpd:dart_item|Dart Throwers]] - Throwing weapons for short-medium range
  * [[en:rpd:wand_item|Wands]] - Magic projectile weapons with charges
