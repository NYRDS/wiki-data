====== Health Dart ======

{{ rpd:images:health_dart_item.png|Health Dart }}

==== Description ====
**Health Darts** are special throwing darts that have healing properties instead of causing damage. The tip of the dart is covered in healing potion, making it unique among the various types of darts available in the game. Rather than harming the target, it heals them by a small amount.

==== Stats ====
  * **Damage Range**: 1-3 (compared to regular dart which is 1-4)
  * **Strength Required**: 8
  * **Price**: 12 gold per dart
  * **Default Quantity**: 1 dart
  * **Random Quantity**: 2-4 darts (when generated randomly)

==== Special Abilities ====
  * **Healing Effect**: When used in combat, it heals the target character by 10% of their maximum HP instead of causing damage
  * **Unique Use Case**: Unlike other darts which harm enemies, this dart can be strategically used to heal allies or oneself
  * **Throwable Weapon**: Functions as a missile weapon that can be thrown at distant targets

==== Usage ====
  * **Healing Allies**: Can be used to heal friendly characters or pets
  * **Self-Healing**: Can be used to heal the player character in emergencies
  * **Strategic Healing**: Particularly useful when low on health potions but with a ranged enemy nearby

==== Availability ====
Health Darts can be found:
  * Occasionally dropped by certain enemies
  * Found in chests in deeper dungeon levels
  * Sometimes sold by the shopkeeper in later visits
  * Craftable from other materials with sufficient alchemy knowledge

==== Tactics ====
  * **Emergency Medicine**: Use when low on health and out of healing potions
  * **Pet Support**: Keep your pet alive during tough fights by healing them remotely
  * **Surprise Element**: Unexpected healing can turn the tide in some encounters
  * **Resource Management**: Consider using when you have excess healing darts but need to conserve regular healing potions
