Dwarf Token is a quest item in Remixed Dungeon. It's a small piece of metal with an unknown purpose that is carried by many dwarves and their larger creations.

==== Description ====
  * **Item Type**: Quest Item
  * **Weight**: 0 (negligible)
  * **Stackable**: Yes
  * **Identified**: Always identified (no identification required)
  * **Upgradable**: Not upgradable
  * **Value**: 100 gold per token

==== Function ====
  * **Quest Item**: Used in the Blacksmith's quest in the Prison level
  * **Blacksmith's Quest**: Collect 6 Golems or 8 Monks to complete the quest and receive a cursed ring of at least +3
  * **Drops**: Can be obtained as drops from Golems and Monks during the Blacksmith's quest

==== Obtaining ====
Dwarf Tokens can be obtained:
  * **From Golems** in the Prison level (part of Blacksmith's quest)
  * **From Monks** in the Prison level (part of Blacksmith's quest)
  * **Selling**: Can be sold to shops for 100 gold per token

==== Strategy ====
  * Collect these during the Blacksmith's quest to complete it and get cursed gear
  * If you don't need them for the quest, they can be sold for a decent amount of gold
  * Since they're quest items, they don't take up much inventory space
