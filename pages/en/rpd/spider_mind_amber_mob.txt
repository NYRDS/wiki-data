The **Spider Mind Amber** ({{icon_plus}} [[en:rpd:SpiderMindAmber_Name|Amber spider]]) is a hostile mob in Remixed Dungeon. It is a specialized spider that uses ranged mental attacks to debilitate enemies.

==== Description ====
The Spider Mind Amber is an unusual arachnid that has developed psychic abilities. Rather than relying on physical attacks, it projects mental effects that can severely debilitate opponents. It prefers to keep its distance, using its mental powers from afar.

  * **Defense Skill:** 5
  * **Attack Skill:** 15

  * **Exp Given:** 9
  * **Max Level:** 10
  * **Loot:** Mystery Meat (6.7% chance)
  * **Movement Type:** Ranged-focused
  * **Can be Pet:** Unknown

==== Special Abilities ====
  * **Ranged Mental Attack:** Can only attack at range, never engages in melee
  * **Debuff Variety:** When attacking, applies a random debuff (Blindness, Slow, or Weakness) for 3 turns
  * **Retreat Behavior:** Actively moves away from enemies when in hunting mode
  * **Mental Resistance:** High damage reduction suggests strong mental defenses

==== Behavior ====
  * **Ranged Combat:** Maintains distance from enemies to use its special abilities
  * **Retreat Strategy:** Moves away from targets when hunting to stay at range
  * **Debuff Application:** Each successful attack applies a random debuff
  * **Defensive Positioning:** Prefers to attack from a safe distance

==== Debuff Effects ====
When it hits an enemy, it can apply one of the following debuffs:
  * **Blindness:** Reduces accuracy significantly
  * **Slow:** Reduces movement and attack speed
  * **Weakness:** Reduces strength and damage output

==== Interactions ====
  * Hostile to the player and other creatures
  * Drops Mystery Meat when defeated
  * Found in specialized spider areas of the dungeon
  * Requires different tactics than regular spiders due to ranged nature

==== Location ====
  * **Areas:** Found in advanced spider-infested regions (levels 8-10)
  * **Levels:** Typically appears in later levels where specialized spiders emerge
  * **Role:** Acts as a support/mage-type creature among spiders

==== Strategy ====
  * **Close Combat:** Approach quickly to force melee combat where it's less effective
  * **Debuff Management:** Be prepared with items/potions that counter the possible debuffs
  * **Quick Elimination:** Remove before it can apply multiple debuffs to the character
  * **Ranged Advantage:** Use ranged attacks to counter its own ranged approach
  * **Resist Debuffs:** Consider items or abilities that resist the possible debuff effects
  * **Prediction:** Understand its retreat behavior and plan to corner or trap it
