====== fire ======


**Fire** is an environmental hazard in Remixed Dungeon that damages characters and spreads to flammable terrain.

==== Description ====
Fire is a harmful environmental effect that damages any character that enters burning cells. Fire originates from various sources and spreads to adjacent flammable terrain each turn. When fire expires on natural terrain, it becomes embers.

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Damage:** Fire damages characters each turn they remain in the burning cell
  * **Spread:** Fire spreads to adjacent flammable terrain each turn
  * **Duration:** Fire burns for 4 turns at each location (decreases by 1 each turn)
  * **Terrain Change:** When fire expires on natural terrain, it becomes embers
  * **Item Burning:** Fire burns items in heaps and carried items of affected characters
  * **Status Effect:** Characters in fire receive the [[en:rpd:burning_buff|Burning]] status effect with 8-turn duration
  * **Level Objects:** Fire affects level objects (chests, statues, etc.) as well as characters
