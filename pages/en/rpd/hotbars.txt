====== Hotbars ======

Hotbars in Remixed Dungeon are user interfaces that allow for quick access to frequently used items and abilities.

==== Description ====
Hotbars provide a quick-access toolbar, typically located at the bottom of the screen, that allows players to access items without opening the full [[en:rpd:inventory|inventory]]. The term "hotbar" is often used interchangeably with [[en:rpd:quickslots|quickslots]].

==== Configuration ====
  * The number of quickslots in the hotbar can be adjusted in the [[en:rpd:ui|User Interface]] settings
  * Players can drag and drop items to the hotbar slots for quick access
  * Quickslots are saved between game sessions

==== Usage ====
  * Items in hotbar can be used with a single tap
  * On desktop versions, number keys (1-9, 0) correspond to hotbar slots
  * Items can be removed from hotbar by dragging them off

==== Hotbar vs Quickslots ====
The terms hotbar and quickslots are often used synonymously in Remixed Dungeon. Both refer to the same interface element.
