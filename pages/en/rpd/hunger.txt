====== Hunger ======

Hunger is a game mechanic that gradually reduces the Hero's health over time. Managing hunger is essential for long dungeon expeditions as starving can lead to death even when HP is not depleted.

==== Description ====
Hunger increases slowly over time, represented by a fullness bar that decreases as time passes. When the hunger bar reaches certain thresholds, the hero experiences different effects that progressively become more severe.

==== Mechanism ====
  * Hunger increases gradually during gameplay
  * The hero starts getting hungry after not eating for a while
  * Different tiers of hunger affect the hero differently

==== Effects ====
  * **Normal**: No negative effects
  * **Hungry**: Minor effects start to appear
  * **Starving**: Severe negative effects and gradual HP loss

==== Food Items ====
Hunger can be managed by consuming food items found throughout the dungeon. Different food items provide varying amounts of fullness:
  * **[[en:rpd:ration_item|Ration]]**: Standard food item
  * **[[en:rpd:pasty_item|Pasty]]**: A bit more filling than ration
  * **[[en:rpd:pumpkin_pie_item|Pumpkin Pie]]**: Sweet delicacy that provides extra satisfaction
  * **[[en:rpd:mystery_meat_item|Mystery Meat]]**: Unidentified meat that might have side effects

==== Strategy ====
  * Keep at least one food item in inventory at all times
  * Manage food resources carefully during long expeditions
  * Use food strategically - it can be a backup when health is low
  * Be cautious with Mystery Meat as it might have negative effects
