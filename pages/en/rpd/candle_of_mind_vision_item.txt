{{ rpd:images:candle_of_mind_vision_item.png|Candle of Mind Vision }}

==== Description ====
The **Candle of Mind Vision** is a special artifact that provides mind vision capabilities. It looks like a regular candle, not something you would expect to find in a dangerous dungeon. Weirdly enough it's rather warm to the touch, despite the fact that it wasn't lit yet.

==== Stats ====
  * **Rarity**: Rare
  * **Weight**: 1
  * **Max Charges**: 50
  * **Type**: Artifact

==== Mechanics ====
When equipped:
  * The candle lights up automatically when taken out of the backpack
  * The flame emits a faint purple light
  * As you look through it, all nearby monsters become visible to you
  * When the charges are depleted, the candle burns out and can't be used anymore
