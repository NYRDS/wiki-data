====== Frost Buff ======

{{ rpd:images:frost_buff.png|Frost Buff }}

Frost is a status effect in Remixed Dungeon that temporarily freezes a character in place, preventing them from moving or acting.

==== Effect ====
  * **Immobilization:** Affected characters cannot move or perform actions
  * **Duration:** The freeze lasts for a specific duration (base duration is 5 turns, modified by Resistance)
  * **Removal:** The effect wears off over time, can be removed by fire damage, or by certain means
  * **Stacking:** Does not typically stack with other movement-impairing effects

==== Application ====
The Frost effect can be applied through various sources:
  * [[en:rpd:potion_of_frost_item|Potion of Frost]] - When shattered, creates a freezing cloud
  * [[en:rpd:wand_of_frost_item|Wand of Frost]] - Direct damage and freezing effect
  * [[en:rpd:ice_elemental_mob|Ice Elementals]] - Can apply frost through attacks
  * [[en:rpd:ice_trap_level_object|Ice Traps]] - May apply frost when triggered
  * [[en:rpd:freeze_globe_spell|Freeze Globe Spell]] - Spell that creates freezing effects

==== Immunities and Resistances ====
  * Some enemies are immune to freezing effects
  * Certain armor or items may provide resistance
  * Flame-resistant characters may have reduced duration

==== Strategic Considerations ====
  * **Benefits:** Can be used to temporarily disable enemies during dangerous encounters
  * **Risks:** Affects both enemies and allies, so use cautiously in group situations
  * **Timing:** Most effective when used on single powerful enemies
  * **Counters:** Affected characters can be targeted more easily while frozen

==== Mechanics ====
  * Applied through the [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/watabou/pixeldungeon/actors/blobs/Freezing.java|Freezing.java]] blob effect
  * Character remains in place until duration expires
  * Does not interrupt ongoing actions that were already started
  * Frost effect causes paralysis, completely preventing action
  * Burning effect is removed when frost is applied
  * Frost effect is removed when the affected character takes damage
