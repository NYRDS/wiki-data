====== Identification Mechanic ======

**Identification** is the process of discovering the properties and effects of unidentified items in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Identification Methods ====
  * **Scroll of Identify**: The primary method for identifying items
  * **Using/Wearing Items**: Equipment becomes gradually identified as it's used
  * **Potion of Experience**: Can identify equipment when used
  * **Well of Awareness**: A level feature that can identify items
  * **Ring of Detection**: Improves the chance of identifying items by use

==== Identified Items ====
  * **Full Stats**: Shows complete item stats and properties
  * **Safe to Use**: Identified cursed items show "cursed" status
  * **Potion/Scroll Effects**: Reveals exact effect of consumables
  * **Enchantments/Glyphs**: Shows specific enchantment or glyph on equipment

==== Unidentified Items ====
  * **Limited Information**: Only basic information is visible
  * **Risk of Curses**: Cursed items may have negative effects when used
  * **Unknown Value**: May be more or less valuable than assumed

==== Identification Tips ====
  * **Prioritize Potions**: Identify healing potions first to ensure safety
  * **Weapons/Armor**: Identify equipment before upgrading to know if cursed
  * **Rings**: Identify rings early to determine their effect
  * **Scroll Replacement**: Keep identifying scrolls available for important items
