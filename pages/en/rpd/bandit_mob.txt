{{ rpd:images:bandit_sprite.png|Bandit Sprite }}

The **Bandit** is a hostile enemy in Remixed Dungeon, a variant of the Thief that appears in the sewers. Like other Thieves, Bandits have special stealing abilities and flee after attacking.

==== Description ====
The Bandit is a type of Thief mob that appears in the early levels of the dungeon. Bandits are dangerous due to their ability to steal from the player and then flee from combat.

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Steal Mechanic**: When attacking, Bandits have a chance to steal an item from the player's inventory
  * **Fleeing**: After a successful steal, Bandits will turn to flee rather than continue attacking
  * **Blindness**: When a Bandit successfully steals, it inflicts 5-12 turns of blindness on the player
  * **Hostility**: Bandits are aggressive and will attack the player on sight

==== Stats ====
  * **Level:** 7
  * **HP:** 15-25 (scales with level)
  * **Attack:** 12-20 (scales with level)
  * **Defense:** 12 (scales with level)
  * **Accuracy:** 10
  * **Evasion:** 12
  * **Speed:** 2 (base speed)

==== Behavior ====
  * Bandits will move toward the player if not adjacent
  * When adjacent to the player, they will attack
  * If the attack successfully steals an item, the Bandit will flee
  * If the attack does not steal, the Bandit will remain in combat
  * Bandits use ThiefFleeing AI after a successful steal

==== Strategy ====
  * Keep valuable items in the support slots or use item protection
  * Be prepared for possible blindness when fighting Bandits
  * Try to kill them quickly to prevent stealing attempts
  * Ranged weapons can be effective to avoid stealing attempts
