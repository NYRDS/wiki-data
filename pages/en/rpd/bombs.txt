====== Bombs ======

Bombs are throwable items in Remixed Dungeon that explode when they hit a tile, dealing damage to all creatures in the blast radius.

==== Description ====
Bombs are explosive items that can be thrown at enemies or groups of enemies to deal area-of-effect damage. They are useful for clearing groups of weak enemies or can be used strategically to destroy obstacles.

==== Types of Bombs ====
  * **Regular Bombs** - Basic bombs that deal moderate damage in a small radius
  * **Bomb Bundle** - A bundle of multiple bombs for a larger explosion
  * **Fire Bomb** - Explodes with flames, potentially igniting enemies
  * **Frost Bomb** - Explodes with frost, potentially freezing enemies
  * **Regrowth Bomb** - Causes plants to grow in the blast area
  * **Shock Bomb** - Creates a shockwave that deals damage to all creatures in line of sight
  * **Shrapnel Bomb** - Uses metal shrapnel for wider damage
  * **Holy Bomb** - Deals extra damage to undead enemies

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Range:** Bombs have a limited throwing range
  * **Explosion Radius:** Damage decreases with distance from the center of the explosion
  * **Timing:** Bombs typically explode immediately on impact
  * **Blast Damage:** Damage is dealt to all creatures within the blast radius
  * **Environmental Effects:** Some bombs can ignite terrain or have other environmental effects

==== Strategy ====
  * Use bombs to clear groups of weak enemies efficiently
  * Be careful not to throw them too close to your hero
  * Consider using bombs to ignite or freeze enemies before engaging in combat
  * Bombs can be useful for dealing with enemies behind obstacles
  * Some bombs have special effects that can be synergized with other items or abilities
