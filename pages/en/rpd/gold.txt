{{ rpd:images:gold_item.png|Gold }}

Gold is the primary currency in Remixed Dungeon used for purchasing items and services.

==== Description ====
Gold is the standard currency used throughout the dungeon. It can be found by looting chests, defeating enemies, or discovering it in various locations throughout the dungeon levels. Gold is used primarily for purchasing items from shops and other in-game transactions.

==== Acquisition ====
Gold can be obtained through various means:
  * Defeating enemies (many enemies drop gold when defeated)
  * Opening chests and containers
  * Finding piles of gold in the dungeon
  * Selling items to shopkeepers
  * Completing certain quests or objectives

==== Uses ====
  * Purchasing items from shopkeepers
  * Buying services (such as identification or curse removal)
  * Trading with NPCs
  * Investing in certain items that may appreciate in value

==== Mechanics ====
  * Gold has no weight and does not affect inventory capacity
  * Large amounts of gold are automatically stacked
  * The hero's gold count is displayed in the interface
  * Gold can be lost if the hero dies and doesn't recover their belongings

==== Strategy ====
  * Prioritize purchasing necessary supplies over luxury items
  * Save gold for critical items or services needed later in the dungeon
  * Consider the value of identification services versus the potential worth of unid items
  * Be aware that some shops may offer better deals than others
