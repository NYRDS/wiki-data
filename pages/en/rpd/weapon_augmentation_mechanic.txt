====== Weapon Augmentation ======

Weapon augmentation is an advanced enhancement system that allows players to customize and improve their weapons with special properties in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Augmentation Mechanics ====
Weapons can be augmented to add special properties:

  * **Damage Augmentation** - Increases minimum or maximum damage
  * **Speed Augmentation** - Adjusts attack speed of the weapon
  * **Special Effects** - Adds specific combat properties to weapons
  * **Trade-offs** - Augmentations typically improve one aspect while reducing another

==== Types of Augmentation ====
**Speed Augmentations:**
  * **Precise** - Increases accuracy, decreases attack speed
  * **Swift** - Increases attack speed, decreases accuracy

**Damage Augmentations:**
  * **Heavy** - Increases minimum damage, decreases maximum damage 
  * **Light** - Decreases minimum damage, increases maximum damage

==== Acquisition ====
  * **Smith NPC** - Can augment weapons in special rooms at higher dungeon levels
  * **Special Items** - Rare items that can augment weapons
  * **Upgraded Items** - Some already augmented weapons may appear in the dungeon
  * **Challenges** - Some challenge modes may affect augmentation chances

==== Strategy ====
  * Consider your character's build when selecting augmentations
  * Balance damage and speed based on your playstyle
  * Some weapons work better with specific types of augmentation
  * Think about how augmentations interact with enchantments and other upgrades
