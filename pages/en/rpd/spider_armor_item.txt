{{ rpd:images:spider_armor_item.png|Spider Armor }}

==== Description ====
Spider Armor is a special armor item made of old spider chitin and some kind of clothing. It's most notable for containing functioning spider glands that can produce webbing, as well as specially designed soles that allow the wearer to move freely on web terrain.

==== Properties ====
  * **Armor Type**: Medium armor
  * **Special Ability**: Produces webbing when plates are pressed
  * **Movement**: Allows free movement on web terrain
  * **Class**: Armor

==== Mechanics ====
The Spider Armor contains functioning spider glands that can shoot out web when sufficient pressure is applied to the armor plates. Additionally, the jagged soles of the armor allow the wearer to move freely on web-based terrain. This makes it particularly useful in spider-themed areas where webbing is common.
