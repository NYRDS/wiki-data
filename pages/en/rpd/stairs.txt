====== Stairs ======

Stairs connect different levels of the dungeon in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Description ====
Stairs are passageways that allow travel between dungeon levels. They are essential for progression as the hero must use stairs to advance deeper into the dungeon or return to previous levels.

==== Stair Types ====
  * **Stairs Down**: Lead to deeper levels of the dungeon
  * **Stairs Up**: Lead to higher levels of the dungeon
  * **Prize Stairs**: Special stairs that lead to special areas

==== Stair Mechanics ====
  * **One-Way**: Once the hero descends past a level, they cannot return to it
  * **Location**: Stairs are randomly placed within each level
  * **Uniqueness**: Each level has one exit and one entrance
  * **Visibility**: Stairs are visible but may be surrounded by enemies

==== Navigation Considerations ====
  * **Timing**: It's important to explore adequately before descending
  * **Preparation**: Ensure sufficient supplies before advancing
  * **Strategy**: Sometimes it's beneficial to return to earlier levels
  * **Special Areas**: Some stairs may lead to secret or special areas
