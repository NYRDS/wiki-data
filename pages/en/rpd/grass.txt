====== Grass ======

{{ rpd:images:grass_terrain.png|Grass }}

**Grass** is a common terrain feature found throughout the dungeon that provides special properties and interactions. It is what high grass becomes when trampled.

==== Properties ====
  * **Movement**: Passable terrain that characters can move through normally
  * **Line of Sight**: Does not block line of sight
  * **Flammable**: Can be burned by fire-based effects
  * **Trampled**: Regular grass is what high grass becomes when trampled

==== Contents ====
  * **Drops**: May occasionally yield dewdrops when moved over
  * **Hidden Items**: Some items may be hidden in grass until stepped on

==== Interaction ====
  * Moving over grass typically has no special effect
  * Some hero subclasses may have special interactions when moving through grass
  * Grass can be burned by fire-based attacks or effects

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Terrain ID**: 2 (Terrain.GRASS constant)
  * **Flags**: PASSABLE (does not block LOS or have special properties)

==== Strategy ====
  * Grass provides normal movement without special benefits or drawbacks
  * Less concealment than high grass, but also doesn't have trampling effects
