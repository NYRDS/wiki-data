====== Mob ======

In Remixed Dungeon, a **Mob** (mobile entity) is a living character that is not the player's hero. This includes enemies, friendly creatures, and NPCs that move around the dungeon.

==== Description ====
Mobs are the various creatures that populate the dungeon levels. They range from weak rats and flies to powerful bosses like the King of Dwarves and Yog-Dzewa. Each mob has specific stats, abilities, and behaviors.

==== Basic Stats ====
  * **HP (Hit Points)**: Amount of damage the mob can take before dying
  * **Attack Skill**: Chance to hit the target (affects accuracy)
  * **Defense Skill**: Chance to dodge attacks
  * **Damage**: Amount of damage the mob deals per successful hit
  * **Speed**: Movement and action frequency relative to the hero
  * **EXP**: Experience points granted when killed
  * **Level**: Affects the mob's stats and how much the hero benefits from killing it
