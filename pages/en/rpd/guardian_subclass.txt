====== Guardian Subclass ======

{{ rpd:images:guardian_subclass.png|Guardian }}

==== Description ====
The Guardian is a subclass of the Gnoll hero class in Remixed Dungeon. Guardians are specialized in the use of shields and protective abilities, making them excel at tanking damage and protecting allies in combat.

==== Abilities ====
  * **Shield Proficiency**: Enhanced effectiveness when using shields - damage reduction to enemies when wielding shields (from HeroSubClass.java defenceProc method)
  * **Defensive Mastery**: Improved armor and defense capabilities
  * **Special Combat Style**: Unique defensive combat technique when using shields (from HeroSubClass.java defenceProc method)

==== Specialization ====
  * Focuses on defensive combat and durability
  * Superior at blocking attacks and mitigating damage when equipped with shields
  * Can use specialized shield armor (obtained via ArmorKit)
  * Damage reduction effect scales with hero's skill level when using shields

==== Lore ====
The Guardian subclass represents the protective warriors of gnoll society, sworn to defend their territory and leaders at all costs. Their armor and combat techniques are designed to absorb damage while supporting their pack.

==== Acquisition ====
The Guardian subclass can be unlocked by reading a Tome of Mastery after defeating the second boss, Tengu. It's only available to the Gnoll hero class.

==== Equipment ====
  * Special armor: [[en:rpd:guardian_armor_item|Guardian Armor]] can be obtained using an Armor Kit on any regular armor (specifically GnollArmor)
  * Preferred weapons: Shield-based combat - special defenseProc when using shields
  * Defensive items: Potions and scrolls that enhance survivability
  * Primary or secondary weapon slot must contain an item with "Shield" in its entity name for bonus effect

==== Mechanics ====
  * **defenceProc Method**: When using a shield (weapon with "Shield" in entity name), the Guardian reflects a percentage of damage dealt back to the attacker
  * **Formula**: Reflected damage = (Random.Float(1, skillLevel + 1) / (skillLevel + 3)) * original damage
  * **Shield Detection**: Checks both primary (weapon) and secondary (left-hand) slots for items containing "Shield" in their entity name

==== Strategy ====
  * Focus on defensive items, especially shields for maximum benefit
  * Use shield-based equipment to trigger the damage reflection ability
  * Leverage defensive abilities to survive longer dungeon runs
  * The damage reflection scales with hero's skill level, making it more effective at higher levels
  * Prioritize items with "Shield" in their entity name to activate subclass benefits
