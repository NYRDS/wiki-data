====== Slow Enchantment ======

{{ rpd:images:chilling_weapon_enchantment.png|Chilling Weapon Enchantment }}

The **Slow Enchantment** is a weapon enchantment in Remixed Dungeon that creates "Chilling" weapons. When applied to a weapon, there's a chance that enemies hit by the weapon will be slowed, reducing their speed and attack rate. The weapon is named "Chilling [Weapon Name]" in-game.

==== Description ====
The Slow enchantment allows a weapon to apply a slowing effect to enemies when they are successfully hit. The effect reduces the enemy's movement and action speed, making them easier to manage in combat situations.

==== Effects ====
When a weapon with the Slow enchantment successfully hits an enemy, the following occurs:
  * **Chance to Apply Slow**: The chance increases with the weapon's level:
    * Level 0: 25% chance
    * Level 1: 40% chance
    * Level 2+: 50% chance (approximately)
  * **Slow Duration**: Duration is randomly between 1 and (1.5 + weapon level) turns
  * **Effect**: The targeted enemy is slowed, reducing their speed and attack rate

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Proc Chance**: Calculated as `Random.Int(weapon.level() + 4) >= 3`
  * **Duration Formula**: `Random.Float(1, 1.5f + weapon.level())`
  * **Visual Indicator**: Weapon glows blue (RGB: 0x0044FF)
  * **Enchantment Type**: Weapon enchantment (extends Weapon.Enchantment)

==== Strategy ====
  * Highly effective against fast enemies that rely on speed for their attacks
  * Useful for creating breathing room during difficult encounters
  * Particularly effective when fighting multiple enemies that move quickly
  * Works well with weapons that have high attack speed for more proc chances
  * Consider using against bosses that rely on speed mechanics

==== Naming ====
The enchantment is named using the string resources:
  * **Slow_Name_0**: "Chilling %s" (e.g., Chilling Sword)
  * **Slow_Name_1**: "Chilling %s" (e.g., Chilling Sword)
  * **Slow_Name_2**: "Chilling %s" (e.g., Chilling Sword)
