The **Ring of Shielding** is a [[en:rpd:ring_item|ring]] in Remixed Dungeon that provides a protective shield effect, periodically absorbing incoming damage.

==== Item Overview ====
  * **Type:** [[en:rpd:ring_item|Ring]]
  * **Rarity:** Rare
  * **Special Effect:** Creates a protective shield that absorbs damage periodically
  * **Usage:** Equipped in one of the ring slots
  * **[[en:rpd:identification|Identification]]:** Becomes identified when worn or when seen in inventory after being identified

==== Special Mechanics ====
  * **Shield Generation:** Periodically generates a protective shield that absorbs incoming damage
  * **Damage Absorption:** The shield blocks a certain amount of damage up to its capacity
  * **Recharge Time:** The shield has a recharge period before it can absorb more damage
  * **[[en:rpd:upgrading_mechanic|Upgrade]] Potential:** Becomes more effective at generating shields with upgrades
  * **[[en:rpd:identification|Identification]]:** Becomes identified when worn or when seen in inventory after being identified
  * **Slot Requirement:** Uses one of the ring slots when equipped
  * **Durability:** The ring's effectiveness may degrade over time with use

==== Strategy ====
  * **High-Damage Situations:** Most effective in situations with frequent high-damage attacks
  * **Consistent Protection:** Provides consistent protection over time rather than burst defense
  * **Boss Fights:** Particularly valuable during boss fights with high-damage attacks
  * **Stacking:** Can be stacked with other defensive measures for maximum protection
  * **Critical Moments:** Use during critical moments when taking unavoidable damage
  * **Early Game:** Can be crucial for survival in the early game when defenses are low

==== Obtaining ====
  * Found in [[en:rpd:chests_mechanic|chests]] throughout the dungeon
  * Available in [[en:rpd:shops_mechanic|shops]] at varying prices
  * Dropped by various [[en:rpd:mobs|enemies]] (more common from magic-resistant creatures)
  * Found as quest rewards from [[en:rpd:npc|NPCs]]
  * Occasionally generated on the floor of special rooms

==== Effect ====
When worn, the Ring of Shielding periodically generates a protective barrier that absorbs incoming damage up to a certain threshold. The shield regenerates over time, providing consistent protection against damage.

According to the game's string resources: "This ring generates a magical shield which will attempt to block incoming damage. The shield's capacity depends on the ring's level, and it takes time to recharge after being broken."
