==== Description ====
The Gnoll Armor (officially called "gnoll-lieutenant suit") is a class-specific armor for the Gnoll hero class. It is one of the special class armors that can be obtained by using an Armor Kit on any regular armor. The Gnoll Armor has a unique special ability called "DOMINATE" that allows the wearer to charm nearby enemies and turn them into pets, but only if the wearer is a Gnoll hero.

==== Properties ====
  * **Armor Class**: Unique class armor for Gnoll hero
  * **Special Ability**: DOMINATE - charms nearby enemies to become pets
  * **Class Restriction**: Only the Gnoll hero can equip this armor
  * **Not Upgradable**: Cannot be enchanted or upgraded
  * **Durability**: Standard armor durability
  * **Image**: Index 25 in armor.png sprite sheet

==== Special Ability: DOMINATE ====
When activated, the DOMINATE ability attempts to charm all visible enemies within field of view and range (up to ShadowCaster.MAX_DISTANCE). The number of mobs that can be dominated is limited by the wearer's level (max is wearer level / 6). The charmed enemies become loyal pets and will fight for the player.

==== Lore ====
According to the game description: "Owners of the Gnoll-Lieutenant suit are well known for their ability to persuade even extremely angry mobs, to be loyal servants of the Crown." This armor represents the commanding presence of Gnoll lieutenants in their society.

==== Acquisition ====
The Gnoll Armor can be obtained by using an Armor Kit on any regular armor, but it is only accessible to players who have unlocked the Gnoll hero class.
