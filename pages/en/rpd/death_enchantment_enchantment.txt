====== Death Enchantment ======

{{ rpd:images:armor_buff.png|Death Enchantment }}

==== Description ====
The Death enchantment has a chance to instantly kill non-boss enemies when they are hit by the weapon. This is one of the most powerful enchantments but does not work on bosses.

==== Mechanics ====
  - The chance to instantly kill an enemy is based on the weapon's level (base 8% at +0, +1% per level)
  - Only affects non-boss enemies (does not work on minibosses and bosses due to resistance system)
  - Higher-level weapons have a higher chance to trigger
  - Provides significant advantage against regular enemies
  - Bosses and minibosses are immune to instant death due to resistance system, but take normal damage

==== Code References ====
  - Java: [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/watabou/pixeldungeon/items/weapon/enchantments/Death.java|Death.java]]
  - The effect is applied in the proc() method with probability increasing with weapon level (base 8% at +0, +1% per level)
  - Boss immunity to Death enchantment is implemented through resistance system - Boss mobs call addResistance(Death.class) in their constructor
