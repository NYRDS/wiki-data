====== Ring Upgrades ======

Ring upgrades are enhancement levels that increase the base stats and effects of rings in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Upgrade Mechanics ====
Rings can be upgraded to improve their performance:

  * **Positive Upgrades** - Each positive level increases the ring's effectiveness
  * **Negative Upgrades** - Each negative level decreases the ring's effectiveness
  * **Curses** - Negative effects that can be applied to rings (removed when upgrading)

==== Positive Upgrades ====
Each positive upgrade level provides:
  * Increased potency of ring's special effect
  * For example, Ring of Accuracy provides better hit chance with higher upgrades
  * Ring of Evasion provides better dodge chance with higher upgrades
  * No change to resource costs or charges used

==== Negative Upgrades ====
Negative upgrades result in:
  * Reduced effectiveness of ring's special effect
  * For example, Ring of Accuracy provides worse hit chance with negative upgrades
  * Lower overall performance in ring's specialized area

==== Acquisition ====
  * **Scroll of Upgrade** - Applies a single upgrade level to any upgradable item (weapon, armor, ring)
    * Also removes curses from the item
    * Does not add special properties to rings
  * **Shop purchases** - Occasionally found in higher-level shops
  * **Treasure drops** - Higher-level rings may spawn upgraded

==== Strategy ====
  * Identify which rings are most beneficial to your playstyle
  * Prioritize upgrading rings that significantly impact your gameplay
  * For rings with high upgrade levels, ensure you can meet any additional requirements
  * Consider that upgrading a cursed ring will remove the curse

==== Preservation ====
  * **Scroll of Remove Curse** - Can remove curses but doesn't directly downgrade rings
  * Upgrading removes curses from rings automatically
