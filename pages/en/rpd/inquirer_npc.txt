====== Inquirer NPC ======

{{ rpd:images:inquirer_npc.png|Inquirer NPC }}

The **Inquirer NPC** is a non-player character in Remixed Dungeon that was designed to provide survey opportunities to players. This NPC is currently non-functional as its survey functionality has been commented out.

==== Description ====
The Inquirer NPC was originally implemented as a survey interface for players, potentially for feedback or user experience data collection. However, all functionality is currently commented out, making this NPC non-interactive.

==== Current State ====
The NPC currently has no active functionality:
  * All survey-related code is commented out
  * The interaction method simply returns true without any actual interaction
  * No survey, privacy policy, or other options are presented to players
  * The NPC serves only as a static character on the map

==== Code Implementation ====
Based on the implementation in [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/nyrds/pixeldungeon/mobs/npc/InquirerNPC.java|InquirerNPC.java]]:
  * Inherits from ImmortalNPC class
  * Contains commented-out Pollfish survey integration code
  * Previously had functionality to show surveys, privacy policy, or decline options
  * The reward() method is also empty

==== Historical Functionality ====
The NPC was intended to have the following functionality:
  * Present survey opportunities to players
  * Provide privacy policy information
  * Show different UI options based on internet connectivity
  * Present a dialog with survey, privacy policy, and decline options

==== Content Verification ====
  * Information source: Java class [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/nyrds/pixeldungeon/mobs/npc/InquirerNPC.java|InquirerNPC.java]]
  * Implementation: All functionality is commented out in current code (likely due to deprecation or privacy concerns)
  * Configuration: Referenced in TiledMaps and MobFactory for spawning but non-functional
  * Last updated: Verified against source code on December 2025
