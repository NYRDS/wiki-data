====== Sewers ======

The Sewers is the first major area of Remixed Dungeon, located directly beneath the city. These levels form the upper levels of the dungeon and serve as the starting area for most adventurers.

==== Description ====
The Sewers lie right beneath the City, their upper levels actually constitute the City's sewer system. Being nominally a part of the City, these levels are not that dangerous. No one will call it a safe place, but at least you won't need to deal with much evil magic here.

==== Level Characteristics ====
  * **Dungeon Depth:** Levels 1-5 of the main dungeon
  * **Difficulty:** Relatively low compared to deeper areas
  * **Environment:** Wet, dirty sewer passages with murkly water
  * **Enemies:** Weaker creatures like rats, gnolls, and basic humanoids
  * **Layout:** Connected passages with some branching paths
  * **Tile Colors:** Green shades (color1: 0x48763c, color2: 0x59994a)

==== Enemies ====
Based on Bestiary.json spawn configuration:
  * **Level 1:** [[en:rpd:snail_mob|Snails]] (1.0 weight)
  * **Level 2:** [[en:rpd:rat_mob|Rats]] (1.0), [[en:rpd:snail_mob|Snails]] (1.0), with rare [[en:rpd:deep_snail_mob|DeepSnails]] (0.03)

  * **Barrels:** 0-2 barrels are placed randomly on each level during decoration
  * **Dew Vial:** Chance to spawn on levels 1-3 if hero hasn't obtained one yet (chance increases as depth increases: formula is Dungeon.dewVial && Random.Int(4 - Dungeon.depth) == 0, meaning 33% on level 1, 50% on level 2, and 100% on level 3)
  * **Sign:** An entrance sign is placed to mark the entrance/exit

  * Manage consumables carefully for the full area
  * Be cautious of Gnoll groups that can be dangerous
  * Prepare for the [[en:rpd:goo_mob|Goo]] boss on level 5
  * Collect basic equipment to survive deeper dungeon areas

==== Connections ====
  * **Start:** Connects to the initial [[en:rpd:town|Town]] area
  * **Next Area:** Leads to the [[en:rpd:prison|Prison]] area at level 5
