====== Jar of Souls ======

{{ rpd:images:jar_of_souls_mob.png|Jar of Souls }}

The **Jar of Souls** is a monster found in the Necropolis area of Remixed Dungeon. It spawns other monsters around itself every 15 turns. The Jar is a passive monster that doesn't deal damage directly - other monsters do that for it.

==== Mechanics ====
  * **HP**: 70
  * **Defense**: 5
  * **Attack**: 1 (does not attack)
  * **Damage**: 0-0 (does not deal damage)
  * **Experience**: 0 (does not grant experience when killed)
  * **Max Level**: 13
  * **Type**: Undead
  * **Behavior**: Passively spawns random monsters when the player is in line of sight

==== Special Mechanics ====
  * When the player is in line of sight, the Jar will spawn a random monster at its location every 15 turns
  * The Jar does not move, attack, or deal damage directly
  * It is equipped with pacified status, making it passive unless attacked first

==== Strategy ====
  * The Jar of Souls is not a direct threat but spawns other monsters
  * It's often beneficial to kill the spawned monsters rather than attacking the Jar itself
  * Consider the Jar's location when planning your route through the Necropolis
  * Since it has minimal offensive capabilities, it can be safely ignored in some situations
