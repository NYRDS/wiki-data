====== Ring of Haggler ======

{{ rpd:images:ring_of_haggler_item.png|Ring of Haggler }}

The **Ring of Haggler** is a rare ring in Remixed Dungeon that reduces the prices of items in shops, making valuable equipment more affordable.

==== Item Overview ====
  * **Type:** Accessory (Ring)
  * **Rarity:** Rare
  * **Special Effect:** Reduces shop prices by 50% (buying) and increases selling prices by 50% (not based on ring level)
  * **Usage:** Passive effect when equipped

==== Special Mechanics ====
  * **Price Reduction:** When buying items from shops, the price is exactly halved when the Haggling buff is active (not percentage-based on ring level)
  * **Selling Adjustment:** When selling items to shops, the price is increased by 50% when the Haggling buff is active
  * **Mechanism:** The ring provides the Haggling buff which is detected by the Shopkeeper's pricing logic
  * **No Level Dependency:** The haggling effect is not enhanced by ring level, so upgrading provides no additional benefit
  * **Identification:** Becomes identified after being worn for a period of time (200 turns by default)
  * **Curse Effect:** When cursed, the ring still provides the haggling effect but with negative consequences as with other cursed rings

==== Strategy ====
  * Essential for getting better value for your gold when purchasing from shops
  * Allows purchase of higher-tier equipment that would otherwise be unaffordable
  * Does not benefit from upgrades, so finding a high-level one provides no advantage over a +0
  * Particularly useful in later levels where equipment is more expensive
  * Consider equipping early if you rely heavily on shop purchases
  * Valuable for players who want to maximize their equipment quality
  * Useful for selling items at higher prices to shops

==== Obtaining ====
  * Found rarely throughout dungeon levels
  * Available in shops (when not identified)
  * Dropped by various enemies
  * Found in containers and special rooms
  * Part of rare treasure drops

==== Effect ====
When worn, the Ring of Haggler halves all shop prices when buying items and increases selling prices by 50%, allowing for better value when purchasing and selling equipment and items.

According to the game's string resources: "This ring will cause shopkeepers to offer slightly better deals. The effect is equal to 5% per ring level for or against you." (Note: This description is misleading as the actual effect is not based on ring level)
