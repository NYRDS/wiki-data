{{ rpd:images:potion_of_liquid_flame_item.png|Liquid Flame Effect }}

**Liquid Flame** is a harmful environmental effect in Remixed Pixel Dungeon that causes fire damage to characters standing in its area. This effect is primarily created when a Potion of Liquid Flame is shattered.

==== Description ====
Liquid Flame creates a fire hazard on the dungeon floor as a spreading pool of fire that deals ongoing damage to any character that remains in it. The effect spreads to flammable terrain and persists for several turns before dissipating. Players should avoid standing in these areas to prevent taking continuous damage.

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Damage:** Deals fire damage each turn to any character in the affected cell
  * **Spread:** Can spread to adjacent flammable terrain
  * **Duration:** Persists for several turns before dissipating
  * **Resistance:** Characters with fire resistance take reduced damage
