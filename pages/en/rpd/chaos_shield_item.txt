====== Chaos Shield Item ======

{{ rpd:images:chaos_shield_item.png|Chaos Shield }}

The **Chaos Shield** is a unique shield item in Remixed Dungeon that has special mechanics related to damage and charges. It's a level 3 shield that can gain and lose levels based on combat interactions.

==== Description ====
The Chaos Shield is the result of fusing a Chaos Crystal with ordinary shield, causing it to manifest random chaotic effects upon a successful block. It's an unusual shield with dynamic properties that can change its level based on combat outcomes.

==== Stats ====
  * **Starting Level:** 3
  * **Min/Max Damage:** 3-4
  * **Delay:** 0.75x (relative to weapon firing speed)
  * **Price:** 60 gold (20 * level)
  * **Type:** Left-hand equipment (off-hand/shield)
  * **Sprite:** chaosShield.png

==== Special Mechanics ====
  * **Charges System:** The shield maintains an internal charge counter
  * **Owner Takes Damage:** When the shield's owner takes damage, charges decrease by 1
  * **Owner Does Damage:** When the owner deals damage, charges increase by 1 (cursed shields disable this behavior)
  * **Degradation:** If charges go below 0 after taking damage and the shield level > 3, the shield degrades (level decreases) and charges reset to required amount for current level
  * **Upgrading:** If charges exceed the required threshold after dealing damage, the shield upgrades (level increases) and charges reset to 0
  * **Charge Formula:** Required charges for upgrade = 5 * (current_level)^1.5
  * **Cursed Behavior:** If cursed, the shield doesn't contribute to the special mechanics (damage dealt doesn't affect charges)

==== Implementation Details ====
The Chaos Shield is implemented as a Lua script that extends the shields library:

  * Implemented in ''RemixedDungeon/src/main/assets/scripts/items/ChaosShield.lua''
  * Uses the ''shields.makeShield()'' function from the shields library
  * Has special handling in ''ownerTakesDamage()'' and ''ownerDoesDamage()'' events
  * ''ownerTakesDamage()'' decreases charges when owner is hit
  * ''ownerDoesDamage()'' increases charges when owner successfully damages enemy (if not cursed)
  * ''desc()'' function provides item description using string resources
  * ''image()'' function determines sprite based on current level
