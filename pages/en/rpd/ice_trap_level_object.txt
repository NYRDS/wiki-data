{{ rpd:images:frost_buff.png|Ice Trap }}

**Ice Trap** is a theoretical trap in Remixed Dungeon that was referenced in some wiki pages but does not appear as a distinct trap type in the actual game code.

==== Description ====
While some wiki pages refer to an "Ice Trap" that applies freezing effects, there is no specific trap implementation in the game code for an ice trap. Instead, freezing effects in the game come from other sources:
  * [[en:rpd:potion_of_frost_item|Potion of Frost]] when shattered
  * [[en:rpd:wand_of_frost_item|Wand of Frost]]
  * [[en:rpd:ice_elemental_mob|Ice Elementals]]
  * [[en:rpd:icecap_plant|Icecap plants]] when picked or trampled
  * [[en:rpd:freeze_globe_spell|Freeze Globe Spell]]

==== Effects ====
The freezing effects in the game (like the [[en:rpd:frost_buff|Frost]] status effect) cause:
  * Complete immobilization of the affected character
  * Prevention of any actions during the effect duration
  * Potential freezing of carried items (see [[en:rpd:frost_buff|Frost]] for details)

==== Strategy ====
  * Be aware that freezing effects exist from multiple sources, not just theoretical traps
  * Carry items that can counteract freezing effects if needed
  * If frozen, wait for the effect to wear off naturally or be prepared with items that can break the effect

==== Content Verification ====
  * This page created to address red link found by find_red_links.py
  * After examining the codebase, no specific ice trap implementation was found
  * Freezing effects in the game are implemented through other game elements (potions, wands, etc.)
  * References to ice traps in other wiki pages may be outdated or refer to similar effects from other sources
