====== Terror Buff ======

{{ rpd:images:buff_fear.png|Terror Status Effect }}

**Terror** is a status effect in Remixed Dungeon that causes affected characters to become frightened and flee from combat.

==== Effects ====
  * **Frightened:** Affected characters become overwhelmed with fear and will attempt to run away from enemies
  * **Movement:** Affected characters will actively move away from enemies in sight
  * **Duration:** The effect lasts 10 seconds by default (Terror.DURATION = 10f)
  * **Behavior:** Affected characters avoid engaging in combat while terrorized

==== Causes ====
Terror can be inflicted by:
  * Special abilities of certain mobs like Wraith that use terror attacks
  * [[en:rpd:horror_enchantment|Horror Enchantment]] on weapons
  * Certain wands with fear effects
  * Some cursed items or dark magic effects

==== Counters ====
  * Potions and items that cure status effects may remove terror
  * Some creatures may be immune to terror effects
  * When a terrorized mob is reduced to 0 HP, the terror effect is removed by the Terror.recover() method

==== Code Implementation ====
When the Terror buff is applied:
  * If the affected character is a mob, any pet they have is released
  * The character's sprite shows the "frightened" status message
  * For English this displays "frightened", for other languages the localized string is used (e.g., "испуган" in Russian)
