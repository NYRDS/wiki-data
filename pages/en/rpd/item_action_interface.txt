====== Item Action ======

==== Description ====
ItemAction is not a buff but an interface in the game code that defines actions that can be performed with items. The interface is used in specific scenarios where items need to perform special actions when carried by a character. Two implementations exist: burnItem used by Burning buff and freezeItem used by Frost buff to affect items carried by the player.
