====== Plants ======

Plants are important elements in Remixed Dungeon that can be grown from seeds and provide various beneficial effects when touched. Each plant has unique properties and can be a valuable resource in the dungeon.

==== Types of Plants ====
  * Earthroot - Provides barkskin protection
  * Firebloom - Deals fire damage to nearby creatures
  * Icecap - Chills nearby creatures
  * Sungrass - Provides healing over time
  * Sorrowmoss - Provides an enhanced throwing plant
  * Fadeleaf - Allows teleportation
  * Dreamweed - Puts creatures to sleep
  * Rotberry - Grows into an Alcoholic Spirit

==== Planting Mechanics ====
  * Plants can be grown by planting their corresponding seeds anywhere on the dungeon floor
  * Seeds can be found throughout the dungeon and may be dropped by certain enemies
  * Some plants can only be found growing naturally in certain level types
  * Once a plant is touched by a character, it provides its effect and disappears

==== Strategy ====
  * Plants should be saved for challenging situations when their effects would be most beneficial
  * Consider the positioning when planting seeds as you'll need to step on the tile to activate the plant
  * Some plants are more valuable than others depending on your current situation
