==== Ring Mechanics ====
  * **Identification**: Like other equipment, rings need to be identified to see their exact effects
  * **Upgrade**: Rings can be upgraded using a [[en:rpd:scroll_of_upgrade_item|Scroll of Upgrade]]
  * **Cursing**: If a ring has a negative level (before being identified), it may be cursed
  * **Degradation**: Cursed rings cause negative effects, while non-cursed rings provide positive effects
  * **Single Use**: Only one ring of each type can be worn at a time

==== Strategy ====
  * Rings are important for character optimization
  * Early game ring identification is valuable
  * Some rings are class-specific in usefulness (e.g., Ring of Haste for mobile classes)
  * Cursed rings can be uncursed with a [[en:rpd:scroll_of_remove_curse_item|Scroll of Remove Curse]]

==== Obtaining ====
  * Found in treasure chests
  * Dropped by various enemies
  * Available in shops (when identified)
