**Ambitious Imp** — an [[en:rpd:npc|NPC]] in Remixed Dungeon that offers quests to the player in the City (5th dungeon level).

===== General Information =====
  * **Type:** [[en:rpd:npc|NPC]]
  * **Behavior:** Friendly [[en:rpd:npc|NPC]], offers quests

===== Description =====
Imps are low-level demons. They're not known for their strength or magical might, but are quite intelligent and sociable. Many imps prefer to live with non-demons. The Ambitious Imp wants to start a business in the dungeon but faces problems from [[en:rpd:golem_mob|golems]] or [[en:rpd:monk_mob|monks]].

===== Quests =====
The Ambitious Imp offers two possible quests:
  * **[[en:rpd:golem_mob|Golem]] Quest:** Kill 6 [[en:rpd:golem_mob|golems]] in the City (5th dungeon level)
  * **[[en:rpd:monk_mob|Monk]] Quest:** Kill 8 [[en:rpd:monk_mob|monks]] in the City (5th dungeon level)

After completing the quest, the player receives a ring at +2 level, enchanted but cursed (the curse can be removed with a [[en:rpd:scroll_of_remove_curse_item|scroll of remove curse]]).

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Type:** NPC (Non-Player Character)
  * **Location:** [[en:rpd:city|City]] level (depth 17-22)
  * **Spawn Chance:** Random chance (higher at lower city depths)
  * **Spawn Condition:** Dungeon depth > 16 with random chance of (20 - depth)
  * **Quest Type:** Kill quest with 2 possible variations:
    * **Golem Quest:** Kill 6 [[en:rpd:golem_mob|Golems]] and collect their tokens
    * **Monk Quest:** Kill 8 [[en:rpd:monk_mob|Monks]] and collect their tokens
  * **Defensive Ability:** Cannot be harmed (1000 defense skill, no damage taken)
  * **Reward:** A specially upgraded ring (level 2, but cursed)

==== Behavior ====
  * Approaches the hero and offers a quest when first seen
  * Reacts differently depending on whether the hero has tokens from required enemies
  * Vanishes after quest completion, saying "See you, [Hero Name]!"
  * If the hero has enough tokens when talking to the Imp, the reward window appears
  * Quest is only active when the Imp has given the quest and it's not completed
  * Doesn't attack the player
  * Interacts with the player when approached
  * Respawns in the City after killing [[en:rpd:golem_mob|golems]] or [[en:rpd:monk_mob|monks]] depending on the quest
  * May disappear after completing the quest

==== Quest Mechanics ====
  * **Golem Quest Option:** Alternative quest requiring 6 [[en:rpd:golem_mob|Golem]] tokens
  * **Monk Quest Option:** Alternative quest requiring 8 [[en:rpd:monk_mob|Monk]] tokens
  * Each time a targeted enemy is killed during an active Imp quest, a [[en:rpd:dwarf_token_item|Dwarf Token]] will drop
  * Reward is a random ring from the level treasury, upgraded to +2 but cursed

==== Strategy ====
  * This quest is generally worth completing as the ring reward is valuable despite being cursed
  * The quest is often easier if you can avoid the required enemy type until you're stronger
  * The cursed ring can be uncursed later with a [[en:rpd:scroll_of_remove_curse_item|Scroll of Remove Curse]]
  * Since Imps are unkillable, they're safe to interact with even when low on health
