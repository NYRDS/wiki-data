====== Drowsy Buff ======

{{ rpd:images:slow_buff.png|Drowsy Status Effect }}

**Drowsy** was a status effect in earlier versions of Pixel Dungeon that caused affected characters to become sleepy and eventually fall asleep if the effect persisted. In Remixed Dungeon, this effect has been replaced by the **Sleep** buff.

==== Effects ====
  * **Sleep Induction:** Affected characters become drowsy and eventually fall asleep
  * **Inactivity:** Sleeping characters cannot take actions
  * **Automatic sleep:** After a drowsy period, characters fall asleep automatically

==== Causes ====
Drowsy effect was previously inflicted by:
  * [[en:rpd:scroll_of_lullaby_item|Scroll of Lullaby]] (now directly applies Sleep)
  * Special abilities of certain mobs
  * Some magical effects or items that induce sleepiness

==== Current Implementation ====
In the current version of Remixed Dungeon:
  * The **Scroll of Lullaby** directly applies the [[en:rpd:sleep_buff|Sleep]] buff instead of a drowsy-to-sleep transition
  * Affected characters immediately fall asleep instead of becoming drowsy first
  * **Java Class:** [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/watabou/pixeldungeon/actors/buffs/Sleep.java|Sleep.java]]
  * **Scroll Implementation:** [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/watabou/pixeldungeon/items/scrolls/ScrollOfLullaby.java|ScrollOfLullaby.java]]

==== Counters ====
  * [[en:rpd:resistances|Sleep Resistance]] may prevent the sleep effect
  * Potions and items that cure status effects may remove sleep
  * Some creatures may be immune to sleep-related effects

==== Historical Context ====
  * The drowsy-to-sleep mechanic was likely removed or simplified in Remixed Dungeon
  * The wiki page may have been based on an earlier version of Pixel Dungeon
  * Current mechanics directly apply sleep instead of the gradual drowsy transition
