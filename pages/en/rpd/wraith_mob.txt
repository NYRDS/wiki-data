====== Wraith Mob ======

{{ rpd:images:wraith_mob.png|Wraith }}

==== Description ====
**Wraiths** are incorporeal undead creatures that are more difficult to hit in combat. They are among the more dangerous undead enemies in the dungeon. A wraith is a dangerous undead creature, formed from the spirit of someone who died violently or with unfinished business. Wraiths are ghostly undead with a translucent appearance. They are particularly difficult to hit in combat and can pass through certain obstacles that block other creatures.

==== Special Abilities ====
  * **Flight:** Always flying, can pass over obstacles and through walls (walkingType = WalkingType.ABSOLUTE)
  * **High Evasion:** Very difficult to hit due to high defense skill
  * **Immunities:** Immune to death effects and terror
  * **High Evasion:** Attack skill is very high and defense is 5x attack skill, making them hard to hit
  * **Incorporeal:** Can pass through walls due to flight ability (walkingType = ABSOLUTE)
  * **Undead Nature:** Immune to poison, bleeding, and other living-targeted effects
  * **Depth Scaling:** Stats adjust based on dungeon depth through IDepthAdjustable interface

==== Stats ====
  * **Health:** 1 HP (fixed, does not scale with dungeon level) (hp(ht(1)))
  * **Attack Skill:** 10 + dungeon depth (baseAttackSkill = 10 + Dungeon.depth)
  * **Defense Skill:** 5 times attack skill (much higher than most creatures)
  * **Damage:** 1-3 + dungeon depth
  * **Speed:** Fast
  * **Exp for Kill:** 0 (no experience gain)
  * **Carcass Chance:** 0 (carcassChance = 0)
  * **Max Level:** 26

==== Characteristics ====
  * **Incorporeal:** Has flight ability, allowing movement through walls (walkingType = ABSOLUTE)
  * **Hard to Hit:** Significantly higher defense than most creatures
  * **Undead Traits:** Immune to poison, bleeding, and other living-targeted effects
  * **Low Health Scaling:** HP scales with dungeon depth but starts at just 1 HP

==== Combat ====
  * **Evasion:** Very difficult to hit due to high defense skill
  * **Immunities:** Immune to death effects and terror
  * **Flight:** Always flying, can pass over obstacles and through walls (walkingType = ABSOLUTE)
  * **Spawns:** With increasing frequency in deeper dungeon levels

==== Location ====
Wraiths can be found in:
  * Deeper dungeon levels where stronger undead dwell
  * [[en:rpd:halls|Halls]] of the dungeon
  * [[en:rpd:caves|Caves]] levels
  * Areas with other powerful undead creatures

==== Tactics ====
  * Use area-of-effect attacks to increase hit chance
  * Items or abilities that reduce evasion may be helpful
  * Ranged attacks might be more effective than melee
  * Fire or holy damage typically effective against undead
  * Consider using debuffs that reduce accuracy or cause blindness on your enemies
  * Note: Killing them provides no experience points
