====== Melee Weapons ======

**Melee Weapons** encompass all close combat weapons in Remixed Dungeon that are used to attack adjacent enemies. This category includes swords, maces, axes, and other close-range armaments.

==== Overview ====

  * **Special Mechanics:** Some weapons have unique properties or effects
