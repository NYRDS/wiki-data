====== Halls Level ======

{{ rpd:images:halls_level.png|Halls Level}}

The **Halls** (Demon Halls) is the fifth dungeon level in Remixed Dungeon, located between the City and the final level. It is a challenging area filled with powerful demons and unique environmental features.

==== Description ====
In the past these levels were the outskirts of Metropolis. After the costly victory in the war with the old god, dwarves were too weakened to clear them of remaining demons. Gradually demons have tightened their grip on this place and now it's called Demon Halls. Very few adventurers have ever descended this far...

The halls feature unique tile types and environmental hazards that make navigation and combat challenging. The level is darker than previous levels, which makes the Torch item particularly valuable here.

==== Level Features ====
  * **Tile Types**:
    * **Cold lava** - A tile that looks like lava but is cold and safe to touch
    * **Embermoss** - Grass-like terrain in the halls
