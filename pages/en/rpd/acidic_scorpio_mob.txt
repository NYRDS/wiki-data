{{ rpd:images:acidic_mob.png|Acidic Scorpio }}

==== Description ====
These huge arachnid-like demonic creatures avoid close combat by all means, firing crippling serrated spikes from long distances. The Acidic Scorpio is a variant of the regular [[en:rpd:scorpio_mob|Scorpio]] with special defensive abilities.

==== Stats ====
  * **HP:** 95
  * **HT:** 95
  * **Defense Skill:** 24
  * **Attack Skill:** 36
  * **Damage:** 20-32
  * **Armor:** 16 (DR)
  * **EXP:** 14
  * **Max Level:** 25

==== Abilities ====
When attacked, the Acidic Scorpio has a chance to reflect some of the damage back to the attacker:
  * Reflected damage ranges from 0 to the full incoming damage amount
  * This makes melee combat against Acidic Scorpios particularly dangerous

==== Behavior ====
  * Keeps maximum distance from enemies
  * Uses ranged attacks exclusively
  * Inflicts Cripple status effect with ranged attacks (50% chance)

==== Resistances and Immunities ====
  * Resistant to Leech enchantments
  * Immune to Poison effects

==== Drops ====
  * Potions of Healing (rarely)
  * Mystery Meat (more commonly)

==== Strategy ====
  * Avoid melee attacks to prevent damage reflection
  * Use ranged weapons or magic to attack from a safe distance
  * Be cautious of the Cripple effect from its ranged attacks
  * Allow distance to be maintained so it doesn't approach you

==== Location ====
  * Found in the Halls level (dungeon levels 23-24)
  * Appears rarely among regular Scorpios (3% chance on level 23, 9% chance on level 24)
