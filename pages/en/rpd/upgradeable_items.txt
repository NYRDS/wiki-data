====== Upgradeable Items ======

Upgradeable items are items in Remixed Dungeon that can be enhanced with scrolls or special abilities to improve their performance and effectiveness.

==== Types of Upgradeable Items ====
  * **Weapons** - Can be upgraded to increase damage output and special effects
  * **Armor** - Can be upgraded to increase defense, resistance, or special effects
  * **Rings** - Can be upgraded to increase the potency of their special effects
  * **Potions** - Some special potions can be upgraded for enhanced effects (like [[en:rpd:potion_of_might_item|Potion of Might]] from [[en:rpd:potion_of_strength_item|Potion of Strength]])
  * **Artifacts** - Some artifacts may have upgrade mechanics, though these are often more complex than simple level increases

==== Upgrade Mechanisms ====
  * **Scroll of Upgrade** - Applies a single upgrade level to any upgradeable item
    * Also removes curses from the item
    * Does not add special properties like enchantments or inscriptions
  * **Scroll of Weapon Upgrade** - Specifically for weapon upgrades
    * Also adds a random enchantment to the weapon when upgraded
  * **Scroll of Armor Upgrade** - Specifically for armor upgrades
    * Also adds a random inscription to the armor when upgraded
  * **Special Abilities** - Some hero classes and subclasses have abilities to upgrade items
  * **NPC Services** - Some NPCs may provide item upgrade services

==== Effects of Upgrading ====
  * **Weapons** - Increased damage range (min/max), potential enchantment addition
  * **Armor** - Increased blocking power, potential inscription addition
  * **Rings** - Increased effect potency of the ring's special property
  * **Curses** - Upgrading removes curses from items

==== Special Considerations ====
  * Some items may have special behaviors when upgraded
  * Cursed items become uncursed when upgraded
  * Upgrading does not affect item properties other than base stats (for basic upgrades)
  * Some items have special mechanics that interact with upgrade levels
