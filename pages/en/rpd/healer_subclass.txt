> **NOTE:** The Healer subclass as described on this page does not exist in the current version of Remixed Dungeon. This page documents concept art or planned content that was never implemented. For the actual Mage subclasses, see [[en:rpd:warlock_subclass|Warlock]] and [[en:rpd:battlemage_subclass|Battlemage]].

The **Healer** was a planned subclass concept for the Mage hero class in Remixed Dungeon. Healers would have focused purely on healing capabilities and support magic, specializing in restorative spells and protective abilities.

==== Abilities ====
  * **Enhanced Healing:** Would have improved effectiveness of healing spells and items
  * **Regeneration:** Would have had passive health regeneration or enhanced recovery
  * **Protective Magic:** Would have had enhanced abilities to shield allies from harm
  * **Restorative Items:** Would have had better effects when using healing-related items

==== Specialization ====
  * Would have focused on healing and support magic
  * Would have utilized restorative spells and protective enchantments
  * Would have had abilities to heal both themselves and others

==== Lore ====
The Healer subclass represented the mystical healers of fantasy lore, dedicated to preserving life and protecting others through divine or natural magic. They would have mastered the arts of restoration and protection.

==== Acquisition ====
The Healer subclass was planned to be unlocked by reading a Tome of Mastery after defeating the second boss, Tengu. It would have been only available to the Mage hero class. However, this subclass was never implemented and was replaced by other subclass options.

==== Equipment ====
  * Special armor: Would have used [[en:rpd:mage_armor_item|Mage Armor]] obtained using an [[en:rpd:armor_kit_item|Armor Kit]] on any regular armor
  * Preferred items: Would have favored healing potions, protective rings, restoration-focused wands

==== Strategy ====
The following strategies were planned for the Healer subclass:
  * Focus on healing and supporting both yourself and allies
  * Utilize restorative items more effectively
  * Build toward a support role in gameplay
  * Leverage protective magic for survival
