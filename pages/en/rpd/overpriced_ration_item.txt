==== Description ====
The **Overpriced Ration** is an upgraded version of the standard food ration, providing more health restoration when consumed. It's a more substantial meal compared to the basic ration, though it comes with a higher opportunity cost in terms of inventory space.

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Type:** Food
  * **Healing:** Restores approximately 50% of the hero's max HP
  * **Weight:** 5
  * **Stacking:** No
  * **Perishable:** No (doesn't rot)

==== Acquisition ====
  * Occasionally sold in shops
  * Sometimes found in chests
  * Better alternative to standard rations when health is critically low

==== Usage ====
  * Eaten as a food source when health is low
  * Particularly valuable at deeper dungeon levels where healing opportunities become scarce
  * Better than standard ration due to superior healing effect

==== Strategy ====
Although overpriced rations are more expensive in terms of inventory space, they provide more efficient healing compared to standard rations. This makes them valuable for emergency healing during deep dungeon dives.
