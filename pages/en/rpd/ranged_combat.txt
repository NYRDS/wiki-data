{{ rpd:images:ranged_combat_illustration.png|Ranged Combat }}

**Ranged Combat** in Remixed Dungeon involves attacking enemies from a distance using various weapons, wands, and spells. This combat style allows the hero to deal damage without being in immediate physical danger.

==== Ranged Weapons ====
  * **Bows**: Use arrows as ammunition, require a free hand to wield
  * **Crossbows**: More powerful than bows but slower, can be used with shield
  * **Throwing Weapons**: One-time use weapons like shurikens, darts, and javelins
  * **Special Ranged Weapons**: Unique weapons with special properties

==== Ranged Combat Mechanics ====
  * Uses [[en:rpd:ballistica_mechanic|Ballistica]] for line-of-sight calculation
  * Range is generally limited (usually just a few tiles)
  * Accuracy is affected by the same attack/defense mechanics as melee
  * Some ranged weapons can pierce through multiple enemies

==== Ballistica System ====
  * Determines line of sight between attacker and target
  * Checks for obstacles that might block the attack path
  * Allows for various types of line-of-sight calculation (projectile, death, light)
  * Used by both ranged weapons and certain spells

==== Ranged Combat Advantages ====
  * Safety: Attack enemies without being in their attack range
  * Positioning: Pull enemies away from groups to fight them one at a time
  * Damage: Some ranged weapons deal significant damage
  * Utility: Can trigger traps or activate mechanisms from a safe distance

==== Ranged Combat Disadvantages ====
  * Ammunition: Most ranged weapons require consumable ammunition
  * Range: Limited range compared to melee in some situations
  * Obstacles: Walls and doors block ranged attacks
  * Lower damage potential in close quarters

==== Ranged Weapon Types ====
  * **Bows**: Standard ranged weapons using arrows
  * **Crossbows**: More powerful but slower than bows
  * **Specialized Bows**: Enhanced bows with unique properties
  * **Throwing Weapons**: Single-use items like shurikens, darts
  * **Javelins**: Thrown spears with good range and damage
  * **Boomerangs**: Return after being thrown, reusable

==== Wands and Ranged Magic ====
  * **Wands**: Magical ranged weapons with charges
  * **Spells**: Magic attacks that can target enemies at range
  * **Ranged Buffs**: Spells that enhance ranged combat effectiveness

==== Ammunition Management ====
  * Ammunition is consumed when attacking
  * Different ranged weapons require different types of ammo
  * Ammunition can be found in the dungeon or crafted
  * Running out of ammunition forces switching to melee or other options

==== Ranged Combat Strategy ====
  * **Conservation**: Use ranged attacks judiciously to preserve ammunition
  * **Positioning**: Maintain distance from enemies while having clear line of sight
  * **Grouping**: Pull enemies away from groups to prevent being surrounded
  * **Environment**: Use doors and narrow passages to your advantage
  * **Surprise**: Attack from safe positions before engaging in melee

==== Ranged vs. Melee Considerations ====
  * Ranged: Safer but consumes resources
  * Melee: More sustainable but riskier
  * Ranged: Better for weak enemies and hit-and-run tactics
  * Melee: Better for strong single enemies and sustained combat

==== Special Ranged Abilities ====
  * **Piercing**: Some ranged attacks can hit multiple enemies in a line
  * **Splash Damage**: Certain ranged weapons affect multiple targets
  * **Silent Attacks**: Some ranged attacks don't alert other enemies
  * **Enhanced Range**: Special enchantments can extend effective range
