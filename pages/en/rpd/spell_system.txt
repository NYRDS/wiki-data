====== Spell System ======

The **Spell System** in Remixed Dungeon allows heroes to use magical abilities through various spells that can be learned and used depending on their class and affinities.

==== Overview ====
  * Spells are magical abilities that heroes can learn and cast
  * Different classes have access to different spell affinities
  * Spells consume mana and have various effects (offensive, defensive, utility)
  * Each spell has specific requirements, costs, and mechanics

==== Spell Affinities ====
  * **Rogue Affinity:** Includes throwing and stealth spells like [[en:rpd:kunai_throw_spell|Kunai Throw]]
  * **Mage Affinity:** Fire, frost and magical spells
  * **Warrior Affinity:** Combat-enhancing spells
  * **Elf Affinity:** Nature and enhancement spells
  * **Necromancer Affinity:** Undead and life-drain spells

==== Usage ====
  * **Mana System:** Spells require mana to cast (see [[en:rpd:mana|Mana]])
  * **Spell Learning:** Heroes learn spells through gameplay progression
  * **Casting Time:** Different spells have varying cast times
  * **Targeting:** Spells may have different targeting modes (self, enemy, area)

==== Spell Mechanics ====
  * **Implementation:** Spells are implemented in Lua scripts in ''scripts/spells/'' directory
  * **Core System:** Built on a spell library system (see ''scripts/lib/spell.lua'')
  * **Customization:** Modders can create new spells using the Lua system
  * **Magic Affinity:** Determines which classes can use specific spells
