**Melee Weapons** are a category of weapons in Remixed Dungeon that are used for close combat. These weapons typically have different damage, speed, and accuracy characteristics that differentiate them from ranged weapons.

==== Description ====
Melee Weapons are used to attack enemies in adjacent tiles. They form the core of most heroes' combat capabilities and come in various types with different statistics and properties.

==== Base Class ====
All melee weapons inherit from the base class:
  * [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/watabou/pixeldungeon/items/weapon/melee/MeleeWeapon.java|MeleeWeapon.java]]

==== Weapon Properties ====
  * **Range:** Adjacent tiles only (melee range)
  * **Damage Types:** Varies by weapon type (slashing, crushing, piercing)
  * **Speed:** Varies by weapon (affects attack speed)
  * **Accuracy:** Varies by weapon (affects hit chance)
  * **Strength Requirement:** Each weapon has a STR requirement that must be met to use it effectively

==== Stats Calculation ====
  * **Minimum Damage:** Tier value (MIN = tier)
  * **Maximum Damage:** Calculated as (tier * tier - tier + 10) / ACU * DLY
  * **Speed:** Delay factor (DLY), lower is faster
  * **Accuracy:** Accuracy factor (ACU), affects chance to hit
