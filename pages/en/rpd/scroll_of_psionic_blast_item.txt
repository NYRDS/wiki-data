==== Description ====
The Scroll of Psionic Blast is a type of scroll in Remixed Dungeon that creates a powerful mental blast affecting all visible creatures.

==== Effect ====
When this scroll is read, it creates a psionic blast that affects all creatures visible to the reader:
  * **Damage:** Deals damage between 1 and 2/3 of the target's max HP (Random.IntRange(1, mob.ht() * 2 / 3))
  * **Blindness:** Causes blindness for 3-6 turns (Random.Int(3, 6)) to all affected creatures including the player
  * **Area of Effect:** Affects all creatures in the field of view (fieldOfView array check)
  * **Self-Damage:** Also damages the player who reads the scroll
  * **Visual Effect:** Screen flashes white (0xFFFFFF color) via GameScene.flash()
  * **Sound:** Plays Assets.SND_BLAST sound effect

==== Properties ====
  * **Weight:** 5
  * **Price:** 80 gold coins when identified, base price when unidentified (price() method)
  * **Identification:** One use to identify (read to learn effect, sets known status)

==== Function ====
  * **Reading:** When read aloud, the screen flashes white and a blast sound is played
  * **Invisibility Dispel:** Dispels invisibility from the reader via Invisibility.dispel()
  * **Blindness Effect:** Causes temporary blindness to all creatures in field of view (including reader)
  * **High Risk/High Reward:** Can eliminate multiple enemies but at considerable risk to player
  * **Mob Iteration:** Iterates through all mobs on the level using Dungeon.level.getCopyOfMobsArray()

==== Obtaining ====
  * Found as random drops in dungeon levels
  * Available in shops
  * Sometimes found in chests
  * More commonly found on deeper dungeon levels

==== Strategy ====
  * Most effective when there are multiple enemies in line of sight
  * Can be used to deal with dangerous creatures you need to blind anyway
  * Consider closing doors to limit the blast to specific areas
  * Timing is critical as you'll also be blinded after using it for 3-6 turns
  * Particularly effective against groups of powerful enemies
  * Damage dealt is between 1 and 2/3 of the target's max HP (not based on current HP)
