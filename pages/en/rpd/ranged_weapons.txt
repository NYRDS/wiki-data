====== Ranged Weapons ======

Ranged weapons are weapons used for combat at a distance in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Description ====
Ranged weapons allow the hero to attack enemies from a distance, typically requiring ammunition like arrows or bolts. They're essential for fighting enemies from a safe distance or when direct combat would be disadvantageous.
