====== Identification ======

Identification is the process of revealing the properties of items in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Description ====
Identification is the system by which unknown items have their properties revealed. Most items in the dungeon start unidentified, and their specific stats, enchantments, or effects are unknown until they are identified.

==== Identification Methods ====
  * **Use**: Using an item (drinking, reading, zapping, etc.) reveals its properties
  * [[en:rpd:scroll_of_identify_item|Scroll of Identify]]: Reveals properties of a single item without using it
  * **Shopkeepers**: Items sold by shopkeepers are typically already identified
  * **Enchanting**: Enchanting an item reveals its properties
  * **Upgrading**: Upgrading an item reveals its properties
  * **Inherent Knowledge**: Some items, like gold, don't require identification

==== Identifiable Item Properties ====
  * **Equipment Level**: The upgrade level of weapons and armor
  * **Enchantments**: Special properties of weapons and armor
  * **Effects**: The specific effect of potions and scrolls
  * **Quality**: Value and effectiveness of items
  * **Curses**: Whether an item is cursed

==== Identification Strategy ====
  * **Risk Management**: Be cautious when using unidentified items as they may be harmful
  * **Scroll Conservation**: Use scrolls of identify strategically on valuable items
  * **Practical Use**: Sometimes using an item is the best way to identify it if it's safe
  * **Inventory Management**: Identify items systematically to avoid confusion
