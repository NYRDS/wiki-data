Keyring is a special container for rings and keys in Remixed Dungeon. Unlike regular bags, it can only hold these specific types of items.

==== Description ====
The Keyring is a special bag that can only hold rings and keys. It provides a dedicated storage space for these items that would otherwise take up regular inventory slots.

  * **Capacity**: Size varies based on hero inventory capacity (backpack size for hero, backpack size + 1 for non-heroes)
  * **Specialization**: Only accepts rings and keys, not other item types
  * **Function**: Dedicated storage for rings and keys to keep them separate from other inventory items
  * **Price**: 50 gold
  * **Not upgradable**: Cannot be enchanted or upgraded
  * **Always identified**: Item properties are always known
