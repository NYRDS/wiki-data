  * Actively moves to engage the player
  * Works in coordination with other Yog organs ([[en:rpd:yogs_brain_mob|Yog's Brain]], Yog's Eye, [[en:rpd:yogs_teeth_mob|Yog's Teeth]], [[en:rpd:rotting_fist_mob|Rotting Fist]], [[en:rpd:burning_buff_fist_mob|Burning Fist]])
  * Cannot be tamed or become a pet

==== Drops ====
  * Drops various valuable items upon defeat (specific drops determined by game mechanics)

==== Strategy ====
  * Should be prioritized as a target due to its healing ability
  * The beckoning effect can quickly overwhelm players, so it's best to isolate it if possible
  * The spawning of [[en:rpd:larva_mob|Larva]] can create additional threats during the fight
  * Use area-effect abilities carefully as they might affect other Yog organs as well
  * Consider eliminating it quickly due to its ability to heal other mobs
