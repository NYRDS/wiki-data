====== Pet ======

==== Description ====
A pet in Remixed Pixel Dungeon is a mob that has been converted to fight alongside the player. Pets behave similarly to regular mobs but are friendly to the player and will attack enemies.

==== Mechanics ====
  * Pets follow the player around the dungeon
  * Pets will attack enemies that come into range
  * Pets have the same stats and abilities as their original mob form
  * Pets do not take up inventory space
  * Pets remain in the dungeon when the player teleports away or ascends/descends stairs

==== Creation ====
Pets can be created through various means:
  * Using the [[en:rpd:sacrificial_sword_item|Sacrificial Sword]] to convert enemies
  * Using spells like [[en:rpd:summon_beast_spell|Summon Beast]]
  * Through specific items or level mechanisms

==== Behavior ====
  * Pets will prioritize attacking enemies over following the player
  * Pets are affected by area of effect attacks (AOE)
  * Pets can die if their HP reaches zero
  * Pets cannot be directly controlled by the player

==== Limitations ====
  * Bosses cannot be converted to pets
  * NPCs cannot be converted to pets
  * Some special enemies cannot become pets
  * The player can only have a limited number of pets at once
