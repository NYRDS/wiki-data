====== Pet ======

==== Description ====
A pet in Remixed Pixel Dungeon is a mob that has been converted to fight alongside the player. Pets behave similarly to regular mobs but are friendly to the player and will attack enemies.

==== Mechanics ====
  * Pets follow the player around the dungeon
  * Pets will attack enemies that come into range
  * Pets have the same stats and abilities as their original mob form
  * Pets do not take up inventory space
  * Pets remain in the dungeon when the player teleports away or ascends/descends stairs
  * Pets are marked with a special flag that makes them ignore the player
  * Pets use the same AI as their original mob type

==== Creation ====
Pets can be created through various means:
  * Using the [[en:rpd:sacrificial_sword_item|Sacrificial Sword]] to convert enemies
  * Using spells like [[en:rpd:summon_beast_spell|Summon Beast]]
  * Through specific items or level mechanisms
  * Using the [[en:rpd:scroll_of_domination_item|Scroll of Domination]]
  * Using the [[en:rpd:spider_charm_item|Spider Charm]] to create spider pets
  * Using the [[en:rpd:chaos_staff|Chaos Staff]] random effects
  * Using the [[en:rpd:possess_spell|Possess Spell]] for temporary control

==== Behavior ====
  * Pets will prioritize attacking enemies over following the player
  * Pets are affected by area of effect attacks (AOE)
  * Pets can die if their HP reaches zero
  * Pets cannot be directly controlled by the player
  * Pets do not trigger traps
  * Pets can be healed by area healing effects
  * Pets are affected by buffs and debuffs

==== Limitations ====
  * Bosses cannot be converted to pets
  * NPCs cannot be converted to pets
  * Some special enemies cannot become pets
  * The player can only have a limited number of pets at once
  * Pets do not persist between dungeon levels (remain on the level where they were created)
