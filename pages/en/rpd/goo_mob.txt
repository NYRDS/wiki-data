====== Goo ======

{{ rpd:images:goo_mob.png|Goo }}

==== Description ====
**Goo** is the first boss in Remixed Dungeon, found in the Sewers (Level 2). Little is known about The Goo. It's origin, purpose, and even form are a mystery. Some think it's a kind of primitive life, others believe it's the physical manifestation of the Dungeon's will. The Goo doesn't appear to move purposefully, but rather flows from place to place, occasionally stopping to absorb more essence from the environment. It's been somehow connected to the appearance of acid in the sewers, which it can use in combat.
