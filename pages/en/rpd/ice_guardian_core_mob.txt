====== Ice Guardian Core (Mob) ======

{{ rpd:images:iceguardiancore_sprite.png|Ice Guardian Core }}

==== Description ====
**Ice Guardian Core** is the main boss of the Ice Caves level in Remixed Dungeon. It's the real target of the battle, while the regular [[en:rpd:ice_guardian_mob|Ice Guardian]] mobs are just distractions that can reform as long as the Core is alive. The Core is manufactured by ancient kobolds to protect their caves and contains the power source that allows Ice guardians to reconstruct themselves.

==== Stats ====
  * **HP/HT:** 1000
  * **Defense Skill:** 10
  * **Attack Skill:** 26
  * **Damage:** 13-23
  * **DR (Damage Reduction):** 11
  * **EXP for Kill:** 5
  * **Level:** Ice Caves level

==== Special Abilities ====
  * **Immunities:** Immune to Paralysis, Toxic Gas, Terror, Death, Amok, Blindness, and Sleep
  * **Death Mechanic:** When the Core dies, all Ice Guardian mobs on the same level are also killed
  * **Loot Collection:** Collects a [[en:rpd:wand_of_icebolt|Wand of Icebolt]] (upgraded), [[en:rpd:skeleton_key_item|Skeleton Key]], and [[en:rpd:ice_key_item|Ice Key]] on death

==== Behavior ====
  * Moves slower than regular Ice Guardian (base speed 0.5f)
  * Represents the core of the Ice Guardian system
  * When killed, completes the Ice Caves boss fight
  * Validates the "Ice Guardian slain" badge upon death

==== Drops ====
Ice Guardian Core typically drops:
  * [[en:rpd:wand_of_icebolt|Wand of Icebolt]] (upgraded by 1 level)
  * [[en:rpd:skeleton_key_item|Skeleton Key]]
  * [[en:rpd:ice_key_item|Ice Key]]
  * Various other valuable items

==== Strategy ====
  * Focus on killing the Core first before it can kill Ice Guardian mobs
  * Avoid engaging too many regular Ice Guardian mobs if possible since they can regenerate
  * The Core has lower defense skill than regular Ice Guardians but much more HP
  * Defeating the Core automatically defeats all associated Ice Guardians
