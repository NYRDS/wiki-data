====== Charges ======

Charges are the power units used by wands and some other items in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Description ====
Charges represent the magical energy stored in items like wands, allowing them to be used to produce magical effects. Different items have different methods of regenerating charges, and some items have limited or single charges.

==== Charge Mechanics ====
  * **Wands**: Most wands have a limited number of charges that regenerate slowly over time
  * **Recharging**: Some items and abilities can accelerate the recharge process
  * **Usage**: Using a wand effect consumes one or more charges
  * **Regeneration**: Charges regenerate at different rates depending on the item

==== Items with Charges ====
  * [[en:rpd:wands|Wands]] - Most wands have charges that replenish over time
  * [[en:rpd:artifacts|Artifacts]] - Some special items have charge mechanics
  * [[en:rpd:rings|Rings]] - Some rings consume charges for special effects
  * **Special Items** - Certain items have unique charging mechanisms

==== Charge Management ====
  * **Economy**: Using charges efficiently is important for survival
  * **Regeneration**: Planning around charge regeneration times
  * **Enhancement**: Items that improve charge regeneration rate
  * **Conservation**: Strategies for conserving charges when low
