The **Exploding Skull** is an undead mob found in the Necropolis area of Remixed Dungeon. It is a unique enemy that explodes upon making contact with the player during its attack attempt.

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Explosion:** When the Exploding Skull successfully attacks a target, it immediately dies and explodes, dealing its damage to the target
  * **No Carcass:** Unlike other mobs, it leaves no remains when defeated (carcassChance = 0)
  * **Undead Nature:** Classified as an undead creature, making it susceptible to certain effects
  * **Low Health:** Has only 10 HP, making it relatively fragile
  * **High Attack Skill:** Has a very high attack skill (125), making it difficult to avoid its attacks
  * **Moderate Damage:** Deals 25-45 damage per attack
  * **Drops Gold:** Rarely drops gold (2% chance)

==== Stats ====
  * **HP:** 10 (10)
  * **Attack Skill:** 125
  * **Defense Skill:** 1
  * **Damage:** 25-45
  * **Defense:** 1 (DR)
  * **Speed:** 1.5× normal
  * **EXP:** 1
  * **Max Level:** 1
  * **Loot Chance:** 0.02 (Gold)

==== Strategy ====
  * Try to avoid its attacks since it will explode and deal its full damage when it hits
  * The explosion occurs upon successful attack, not just when it gets adjacent
  * Due to its high attack skill, it's difficult to dodge
  * Consider using ranged attacks or area effect spells to defeat it safely
