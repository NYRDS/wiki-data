**Glyphs** are special enchantments that can be applied to armor in Remixed Dungeon, providing various passive effects and bonuses.

==== Description ====
Glyphs are special armor enchantments that provide passive benefits to the wearer. Unlike weapon enchantments which often affect attacks, glyphs typically offer defensive or utility benefits.

==== Types of Glyphs ====
  * [[en:rpd:glyph_of_anti_entropy_item|Glyph of Anti-Entropy]] - Protection against energy-disrupting effects
  * [[en:rpd:glyph_of_bounce_item|Glyph of Bounce]] - Reflects damage back to attackers
  * [[en:rpd:glyph_of_displacement_item|Glyph of Displacement]] - Teleports wearer away when damaged
  * [[en:rpd:glyph_of_entanglement_item|Glyph of Entanglement]] - Creates rooted earth armor when damaged
  * [[en:rpd:glyph_of_metabolism_item|Glyph of Metabolism]] - Converts damage taken into healing
  * [[en:rpd:glyph_of_multiplicity_item|Glyph of Multiplicity]] - Creates mirror images occasionally
  * [[en:rpd:glyph_of_potential_item|Glyph of Potential]] - Generates energy for wands based on damage taken
  * [[en:rpd:glyph_of_stench_item|Glyph of Stench]] - Releases toxic gas when damaged
  * [[en:rpd:glyph_of_viscosity_item|Glyph of Viscosity]] - Stores damage taken for later slow release

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Armor Requirement**: Applied to high-tier armor pieces
  * **Passive Effects**: Benefits activate automatically when conditions are met
  * **Single Application**: Each armor can only have one glyph
  * **Permanent**: Glyphs are permanently applied to armor once added

==== Acquisition ====
  * **Found on**: High-level armor drops
  * **Crafting**: Potentially craftable if recipes exist
  * **Special Locations**: Found in specific dungeon areas

==== Strategy ====
  * **Class Match**: Select glyphs that complement your hero class
  * **Situational Awareness**: Consider typical threats when choosing glyphs
  * **Armor Selection**: Higher defense base armor benefits more from defensive glyphs
  * **Risk vs Reward**: Some glyphs have activation conditions that may be disadvantageous
