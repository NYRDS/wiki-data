====== Glyphs ======

**Glyphs** are special enchantments that can be applied to armor in Remixed Dungeon to provide additional magical effects or bonuses.

==== Description ====
Glyphs are special properties that can be applied to armor pieces to provide various magical effects. They function similarly to weapon enchantments but are specifically for armor. Each armor piece can have one glyph, and the glyph remains when the armor is upgraded.

==== Types of Glyphs ====
  * **Defensive Glyphs:** Provide protection or defensive benefits
  * **Offensive Glyphs:** Provide counter-attack or damage-dealing effects
  * **Utility Glyphs:** Provide various utility benefits like healing or charging
