==== Description ====
According to the in-game description: "It's truly hard to believe that, this magnificent statue isn't just another decoration, but a malicious creature waiting for an unsuspecting adventurer. At first glance you could've sworn that it's _%s_ was just part of it's arm."

==== Item Class ====

  * **Damage:** dungeon depth / 4 + 1 to dungeon depth
  * **EXP for Kill:** 0

==== Behavior ====
  * **Passive Nature:** The statue is normally passive and will not attack first (inherited from [[en:rpd:revived_statue|Revived Statue]])
  * **Aggro Trigger:** Becomes hostile when attacked, when a Scroll of Rage is used nearby, or when other hostile actions are taken
  * **Immunities:** Immune to Toxic Gas, Poison, Bleeding, and Leech status effects (inherited from [[en:rpd:revived_statue|Revived Statue]])
  * **Resistances:** Resistant to Death enchantment and Scroll of Psionic Blast (inherited from [[en:rpd:revived_statue|Revived Statue]])
  * **Movement:** Does not follow the player around the dungeon (doesn't beckon) (inherited from [[en:rpd:revived_statue|Revived Statue]])

==== Equipment ====
  * **Weapon:** Always carries a [[en:rpd:golden_sword|Golden Sword]] +4
  * **Weapon Properties:** The Golden Sword is pre-identified and always upgraded to +4
  * **Strength Requirement:** Statue's strength is adjusted to match the required strength of the [[en:rpd:golden_sword|Golden Sword]]

==== Habitat ====
  * Much rarer variant than regular [[en:rpd:revived_statue|Revived Statue]]
  * Found in special rooms and treasure areas throughout the dungeon
  * Like other statues, more likely to appear on deeper dungeon levels due to scaling stats

==== Strategy ====
  * Since the statue is passive, you can often avoid combat by not attacking it or using rage-inducing items nearby
  * If you do engage, be aware that its damage scales with dungeon depth
  * Guaranteed to drop a [[en:rpd:golden_sword|Golden Sword]] +4 upon defeat - this is its main value
  * The [[en:rpd:golden_sword|Golden Sword]] +4 is a valuable high-level weapon with special properties
  * Magic damage and ranged attacks can be effective since the statue has no special magic resistance beyond its resistances
