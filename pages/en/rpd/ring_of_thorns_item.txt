{{ rpd:images:ring_of_thorns_item.png|Ring of Thorns }}

A Ring of Thorns is a ring in Remixed Dungeon that provides defensive benefits by damaging enemies when they attack the wearer.

==== Effect ====
The Ring of Thorns has a passive effect that activates when the wearer takes damage from a melee attack:
  * **Thorns Damage:** When the wearer is hit by a melee attack, the attacker takes damage equal to a percentage of the damage dealt
  * **Damage Return:** The percentage of damage returned increases with ring level
  * **Melee Only:** Only triggers on melee attacks, not ranged or magical attacks

==== Properties ====
  * **Rarity:** Rare
  * **Weight:** 2
  * **Durability:** Permanent
  * **Slot:** Accessory (Ring slot)
  * **Curses:** Can be cursed, turning the effect against the wearer

==== Function ====
  * **Passive Effect:** Works automatically when equipped
  * **Scaling:** Damage return percentage increases with ring level (+1)
  * **Thorns Damage:** When hit by a melee attack, attacker takes percentage of damage back
  * **Curse Reverse:** If cursed, the wearer takes the returned damage instead

==== Strategy ====
  * Effective for close combat heroes who take regular melee damage
  * Particularly useful against single powerful enemies when fighting in melee
  * Less effective against ranged enemies or magic users
  * More effective at higher levels when the ring is upgraded
  * Consider the risk vs. benefit against enemies with dangerous attacks
  * Good for defensive builds that expect to take damage
