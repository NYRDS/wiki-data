====== Ring Item ======

{{ rpd:images:ring_item.png|Ring Item }}

**Rings** are special equipment items in Remixed Dungeon that provide passive bonuses to the hero. Unlike other equipment, rings provide ongoing effects rather than immediate combat benefits.

==== Description ====
Rings are worn on the hero's fingers and provide continuous passive effects that enhance various aspects of gameplay. The hero has two ring slots, allowing for two different ring effects to be active simultaneously. Rings are generally rare and powerful items that can significantly impact gameplay.

==== Stats ====
  * **Effect Type:** Each ring provides a specific type of bonus
  * **Effect Strength:** The magnitude of the bonus, often scales with ring level
  * **Durability:** Rings degrade over time with use
  * **Rarity:** Most rings are rare and found infrequently
