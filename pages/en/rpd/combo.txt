{{ rpd:images:combo_sprite.png|Combo Effect }}

Combo is a status effect in Remixed Dungeon that tracks consecutive successful hits by the [[en:rpd:gladiator_subclass|Gladiator]] subclass and increases damage.

==== Description ====
The Combo effect tracks consecutive successful hits by the Gladiator subclass. After 3 successful consecutive hits, each additional hit increases damage by 20% per hit. The combo is broken if a hit misses or if the Gladiator takes damage.

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Hit Counter:** Tracks the number of consecutive successful hits
  * **Activation Threshold:** Damage bonus starts after 3 successful hits (count >= 3)
  * **Damage Bonus:** After 3 hits, damage multiplier is (count - 2) / 5f (e.g., 4th hit = 20% more damage, 5th hit = 40% more, etc.)
  * **Duration:** Duration is calculated as 1.41f - count / 10f after reaching 3+ hits
  * **Reset:** Combo resets after missing a hit or taking damage

==== Effect Calculation ====
  * Hits 1-2: No damage bonus (returns 0 additional damage)
  * Hit 3: First damage bonus hit
  * Hit 4+: Damage bonus of (hit number - 2) / 5f
    * 4th hit: (4-2)/5 = 0.4 or 40% more damage
    * 5th hit: (5-2)/5 = 0.6 or 60% more damage
  * The damage bonus is calculated as: damage * (count - 2) / 5f

==== Badge Recognition ====
  * The Combo effect validates the Mastery Combo badge when reaching 3+ hits
  * Achievement: Badges.validateMasteryCombo(count) is called when combo conditions are met

==== Strategy ====
  * For Gladiators: Maintain as many consecutive hits as possible to maximize damage
  * The effect expires automatically with time, so act quickly to build up the combo
  * Avoid taking damage or missing attacks when trying to build a high combo
  * The combo effect is lost if the Gladiator takes any damage

  * **Icon:** Uses BuffIndicator.COMBO icon
  * **Implementation:** Extends the base Buff class
  * **Auto-expiration:** The buff automatically detaches when act() is called
