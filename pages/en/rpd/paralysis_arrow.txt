{{ rpd:images:paralysis_arrow_item.png|Paralysis Arrow }}

**Paralysis Arrow** is a special ranged ammunition item in Remixed Pixel Dungeon that paralyzes enemies on hit.

==== Description ====
A wooden arrow with a head soaked in paralytic material. When this arrow hits an enemy, it applies a paralysis effect that prevents the target from acting for a short time. This is created by "moistening" a Common Arrow with a Potion of Paralytic Gas.

==== Stats ====
  * **Damage:** 0-4 base points (modified by bow damage factor when fired)
  * **Delay:** 0.75x (relative to weapon firing speed)
  * **Durability:** Single use (consumed on impact)
  * **Price:** Cannot be purchased in shops; only created through moistening
  * **Weight:** 1

==== Properties ====
  * **Type:** Throwing/Ammunition (Special)
  * **Usage:** For use with ranged weapons like bows
  * **Consumable:** Each arrow is consumed after being shot
  * **Stackable:** Can stack up to very high quantities
  * **Special Effect:** Paralyzes the target on hit, preventing actions temporarily

==== Creation ====
Paralysis Arrows can be created by using a [[en:rpd:potion_of_paralytic_gas_item|Potion of Paralytic Gas]] on regular [[en:rpd:common_arrow_item|Common Arrows]]. This process is called "moistening" and transforms the basic arrow into one with special properties.

==== Mechanics ====
  * When hitting an enemy, applies the Stun status effect (which has paralysis-like effects)
  * Stun completely stops the target from acting for 4 turns (duration may be modified by resistances)
  * Stunned targets remain vulnerable and can still take damage normally
  * The effect wears off after the duration expires or when the target takes sufficient damage
  * Does not stack with other status effects like Frost or Burning

==== Availability ====
  * **Creation Only:** Cannot be found as random loot; must be created by moistening
  * **Required Materials:** Common Arrow + Potion of Paralytic Gas
  * **Alchemy:** Part of the game's alchemy system for creating special ammunition

==== Strategy ====
  * Excellent for interrupting dangerous enemies or bosses during their turns
  * Allows for safe attacks on paralyzed targets since they can't act
  * Particularly effective against ranged enemies that would otherwise attack from a distance
  * Good for taking down one enemy in a group while others approach
  * Useful for creating breathing room during difficult encounters
