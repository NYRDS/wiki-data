{{ rpd:images:shadow_mob.png|Shadow }}

==== Description ====
**Shadows** - mysterious entities that live inside prison walls. They silently wander through the ruins of the ancient prison, only occasionally showing themselves to adventurers, usually in their latest adventure. They are fast and swift creatures that can move through walls making them difficult to fight with ranged weapons.

==== Special Abilities ====
  * **Wall Walking:** Can move through walls (walkingType = WalkingType.WALL)
  * **Movement through walls:** Main feature of shadows - ability to move inside walls
  * **Immunity to ranged attacks:** Because of this shadows are nearly impossible to attack with throwing weapons or wands
  * **Attack only in doorways:** Ranged attack can be applied only if shadow stands in a doorway
  * **High speed:** Shadows move twice as fast as the player (speed() = 2.0f)
  * **Fast attack:** Attack occurs twice as fast as normal (attackDelay = 0.5f)
  * **Statistics:**
    * **Health:** 20 HP (hp(ht(20)))
    * **Min damage:** 5
    * **Max damage:** 10
    * **Attack skill:** 10
    * **Defense skill:** 15
    * **XP for kill:** 5
    * **Max Level:** 10
    * **Corpse chance:** 0 (carcassChance = 0)
  * **Special behavior:** When stunned, shadows can exit walls and walk on the floor
