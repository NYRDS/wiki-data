====== Hunger ======

Hunger is a status condition that affects the hero over time in Remixed Dungeon.

==== Description ====
Hunger is a gradual status effect that represents the hero's need for sustenance. As hunger increases, it begins to negatively affect the hero's health. Managing hunger through food consumption is essential for long-term survival.

==== Hunger Stages ====
  * **Satiated** - No effect, recently eaten
  * **Not Hungry** - No effect, normal state
  * **Hungry** - No immediate effects but approaching danger
  * **Starving** - Begins to lose health over time
  * **Severe Starvation** - Rapid health loss (if applicable in mod)

==== Hunger Mechanics ====
  * **Natural Increase**: Hunger increases over time as the game progresses
  * **Health Drain**: When starving, health slowly decreases
  * **Food Consumption**: Eating food resets hunger level
  * **Duration**: Different foods provide different amounts of satiety

==== Food Items ====
  * [[en:rpd:ration_item|Ration]] - Basic food supply
  * [[en:rpd:overpriced_ration_item|Overpriced Ration]] - Shop-bought food
  * [[en:rpd:meat_pie_item|Meat Pie]] - More nutritious food
  * [[en:rpd:fruit_item|Fruit]] - Light sustenance
  * [[en:rpd:mystery_meat_item|Mystery Meat]] - Meat from defeated creatures
  * [[en:rpd:frozen_carpaccio_item|Frozen Carpaccio]] - Long-lasting food that doesn't spoil

==== Hunger Management ====
  * **Conservation**: Preserve food for times when it's most needed
  * **Diversity**: Different foods may provide different benefits
  * **Planning**: Consider hunger when planning for long expeditions
  * **Rationing**: Balance between satiation and conservation
