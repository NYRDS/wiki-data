====== Shaman Armor Item ======

**Shaman Armor** is a special armor item in Remixed Dungeon, specifically crafted for the [[en:rpd:shaman_subclass|Shaman]] subclass of the [[en:rpd:elf_class|Elf]] class. It can be created by using an [[en:rpd:armor_kit_item|Armor Kit]] on any regular armor.

==== Description ====
The Shaman Armor is a mystical robe worn by Elven Shamans that enhances their ability to channel wand magic. This armor provides protection while not impeding the caster's movements.

==== Acquisition ====
  * Created by applying an [[en:rpd:armor_kit_item|Armor Kit]] to any armor while the hero is a [[en:rpd:shaman_subclass|Shaman]]
  * The [[en:rpd:armor_kit_item|Armor Kit]] can be found in the city level (dropped by the King boss)
  * The base armor retains its level and any existing upgrades/enchantments

==== Properties ====
  * **Armor class:** Medium armor
  * **Durability:** Standard for cloth armor
  * **Special effect:** May provide bonuses when channeling wand magic (specifics depend on the base armor type transformed)

==== Mechanics ====
  * When the Elf's [[en:rpd:shaman_subclass|Shaman]] subclass uses a wand as a melee weapon, the Shaman Armor may provide additional effects or increased success rate
  * The armor inherits the base properties of the original armor piece
  * All upgrades and enchantments from the original armor are preserved during transformation

==== Strategy ====
  * Essential equipment for maximizing the Shaman's wand-as-melee weapon combat style
  * Choose the base armor carefully before transformation, as the resulting Shaman Armor will inherit its properties
  * Can be upgraded like any other armor using [[en:rpd:scroll_of_upgrade_item|Scrolls of Upgrade]]

==== Lore ====
The Shaman Armor represents the fusion of Elven craftsmanship and magical essence, tailored specifically for those who walk the path of wand mastery combined with physical combat.
