====== Upgrading ======

**Upgrading** is a fundamental mechanic in Remixed Dungeon that allows players to improve their equipment using various scrolls and items.

==== Overview ====
Upgrading enhances the effectiveness of items by increasing their stats and capabilities. The most common method involves using [[en:rpd:scroll_of_upgrade_item|Scrolls of Upgrade]] to improve weapons, armor, rings, and other equipment.

==== Upgrading Process ====
  * **Scroll of Upgrade**: Standard item to upgrade equipment by +1 level
  * **Application**: Can be applied to [[en:rpd:weapon_item|Weapons]], [[en:rpd:armor_item|Armor]], [[en:rpd:ring_item|Rings]], and other upgradeable items
  * **Immediate Effect**: Provides immediate stat improvements upon use
  * **Level Scaling**: Each upgrade level provides consistent stat bonuses

==== Effects by Item Type ====
  * **Weapons**: Increased damage range and potential special effects
  * **Armor**: Improved defense rating (DR) and protection
  * **Rings**: Enhanced magical properties
  * **Wands**: More charges and potentially faster recharging
  * **Artifacts**: Improved effectiveness and sometimes additional charges

==== Special Upgrading Items ====
  * [[en:rpd:scroll_of_upgrade_item|Scroll of Upgrade]] - Standard upgrade item
  * [[en:rpd:scroll_of_weapon_upgrade_item|Scroll of Weapon Upgrade]] - Specialized for weapons
  * [[en:rpd:scroll_of_enchantment_item|Scroll of Enchantment]] - Adds enchantments to weapons or glyphs to armor
  * [[en:rpd:armor_kit_item|Armor Kit]] - Converts armor to class-specific armor
  * [[en:rpd:weapon_kit_item|Weapon Kit]] - Converts weapons to class-specific weapons

==== Risks and Considerations ====
  * **Curse Risk**: Applying upgrades to items with curses can cause negative effects
  * **Incompatibility**: Some enchantments/glyphs may be incompatible with existing ones
  * **Cursed Items**: Upgrading cursed items may result in harmful effects until uncursed

==== Strategy ====
  * **Priority**: Generally prioritize upgrading effective weapons and armor first
  * **Timing**: Early game upgrades have more proportional impact on survival
  * **Resource Management**: Balance between immediate needs and long-term upgrades
  * **Cautious Use**: Be careful when upgrading cursed items without uncursing them first
