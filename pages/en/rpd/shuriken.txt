**Shuriken** are throwing weapons that can be used to attack enemies from a distance.

==== Properties ====
  * **Usage**: Thrown at enemies to deal damage
  * **Durability**: Each shuriken is single-use when thrown
  * **Speed**: Fast attack speed with DLY = 0.5f allowing multiple throws per turn
  * **Damage**: Moderate damage (MIN: 2, MAX: 6) for a throwing weapon
  * **Range**: Effective at medium range
  * **STR Required**: 13 STR to use effectively
  * **Price**: 15 gold per shuriken
  * **Behavior**: Fast rotating projectile that moves in a straight line

==== Advantages ====
  * High attack speed allows multiple attacks per turn
  * Can hit enemies that are several tiles away
  * Can be used when trapped or surrounded
  * Good for chipping away at enemy health before melee combat
  * High rate of fire (very fast throw speed)

==== Disadvantages ====
  * Each shuriken is consumed after use
  * Lower damage compared to melee weapons of similar level
  * Requires ammunition
  * Higher STR requirement (13 STR) compared to other throwing weapons like darts

==== Strategy ====
  * Useful for softening up enemies before engaging in melee
  * Good for hitting enemies that are just out of melee range
  * Effective against groups of weaker enemies
  * Can be used while under the effect of certain buffs
  * High rate of fire allows applying debuffs more frequently (like when used with enchantments)
  * Often found in groups of 5-15 when randomly generated
