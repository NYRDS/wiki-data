====== Cooldown ======

Cooldown is a timing mechanism in Remixed Dungeon that governs how frequently certain abilities, items, or effects can be used or reoccur.

==== Description ====
Cooldown refers to the waiting period that must pass before a specific ability, item, or effect can be used again. This prevents overuse of powerful abilities and adds strategic timing to gameplay.

==== Types of Cooldowns ====
  * **Item Cooldowns** - Time before certain items can be used again
  * **Ability Cooldowns** - Time before special abilities can be activated
  * **Buff Cooldowns** - Time intervals for buff effect updates
  * **Hero Ability Cooldowns** - Class-specific ability timing restrictions

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Turn-Based:** Cooldowns typically count down with each turn
  * **Duration:** Varies depending on the specific ability or item
  * **Stacking:** Multiple cooldowns can occur simultaneously
  * **Reduction:** Some items or effects may reduce cooldown duration
  * **Reset:** Cooldowns may reset under certain conditions

==== Items with Cooldowns ====
  * Several artifacts have cooldown periods
  * Some special weapons may have cooldowns
  * Potions with lasting effects may have cooldowns before reuse
  * Scroll-like items with rechargeable properties

==== Strategy ====
  * Plan actions around cooldown periods
  * Avoid using high-cooldown abilities inappropriately
  * Consider cooldown reduction items for frequently used abilities
  * Time important abilities to make the most of cooldown periods
  * Be aware of simultaneous cooldowns that might conflict

==== Class and Subclass Abilities ====
  * Some subclass abilities have cooldowns between uses
  * Certain hero classes have abilities with cooldown periods
  * Cooldowns balance powerful class-specific abilities

==== Special Considerations ====
  * Cooldowns affect tactical decision-making in combat
  * Some items or conditions can reduce cooldown periods
  * Cooldown mechanics may interact with speed or time effects
  * Understanding cooldowns is key to efficient resource management
