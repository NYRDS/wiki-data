The **Rotten Ration** is a spoiled food item that has gone bad after being left unused for too long in the dungeon environment.

==== Description ====
A once edible ration that has spoiled. It has a very unpleasant smell and appearance. The hero cannot eat this item without suffering consequences.

==== Effects ====
  * **Negative Effect**: Eating causes poisoning and other negative status effects
  * **Purification**: Can be purified back into a regular [[en:rpd:ration_item|Ration]] through special means
  * **Hunger**: Does not satisfy hunger when consumed
  * **Health Impact**: Causes damage to the hero's health when consumed

==== Acquisition ====
  * **Deterioration**: A regular [[en:rpd:ration_item|Ration]] transforms into a Rotten Ration when left unused for too long
  * **Dungeon**: Sometimes found in dungeon containers as part of natural spoilage

==== Mechanics ====
  * Regular rations left in the hero's inventory for extended periods will eventually become rotten
  * The transformation happens automatically over time
  * [[en:rpd:food_item|Food]] items in general have a shelf life in the dungeon environment

==== Strategy ====
  * Consume rations before they become rotten
  * Consider purification options if you don't need immediate food
  * Store food in a safe location if you don't plan to use it immediately
