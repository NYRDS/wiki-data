{{ rpd:images:scrollofidentify_sprite.png|Quickslots }}

**Quickslots** are special inventory slots in Remixed Dungeon that allow the hero to quickly access frequently used items during combat or exploration.

==== Description ====
Quickslots provide rapid access to important items such as potions, scrolls, bombs, food, or other consumables without having to open the full inventory screen. The number of quickslots can be adjusted in settings and depends on screen width (default is usually 4, but can be increased or decreased).

==== Usage ====
  * **Item Assignment:** Items can be assigned to quickslots by dragging them to the slot
  * **Quick Access:** Items can be used with a single tap during gameplay
  * **Reusability:** Empty quickslot can be refilled with new items of the same type
  * **Hotkeys:** On desktop versions, quickslots can be accessed with number keys (1-9,0 for first 10 slots)
  * **Adjustable Quantity:** The number of quickslots can be changed in the UI settings menu using plus/minus buttons
