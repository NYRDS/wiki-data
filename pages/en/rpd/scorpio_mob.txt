{{ rpd:images:mob_Scorpio.png|Scorpio }}

==== Description ====
These huge arachnid-like demonic creatures avoid close combat by all means, firing crippling serrated spikes from long distances. They are dangerous ranged enemies that keep their distance from the player.

==== Stats ====
  * **HP**: 95
  * **Level**: 25 (Max)
  * **Defense Skill**: 24
  * **Attack Skill**: 36
  * **Damage**: 20-32
  * **Armor**: 16
  * **Speed**: Standard
  * **Exp Given**: 14
  * **View Distance**: Normal + 1 tile (enhanced when spawned)

==== Abilities ====
  * **Ranged Attack**: Scorpios exclusively use a ranged attack, maintaining distance from enemies
  * **Cripple Shot**: Every other ranged attack has a 50% chance to apply the Cripple debuff (lasts 2 turns)
  * **Avoidance**: When in hunting mode, actively moves away from targets rather than towards them
  * **Resistance**: Immune to Leech and Poison effects

==== Behavior ====
  * **Ranged Focus**: Only attacks from range, will not engage in melee
  * **Retreat Pattern**: When in hunting state, moves further away from the player rather than closer
  * **Distance Maintenance**: Tries to maintain maximum possible distance from its target
  * **Enhanced Vision**: When spawned on a level, has an increased view distance (normal + 1 tile)

==== Drops ====
  * **Potion of Healing**: 1 in 8 chance to drop
  * **Mystery Meat**: 1 in 6 chance to drop (when no healing potion is dropped)
  * **Nothing**: Otherwise

==== Strategy ====
  * **Close Range Advantages**: Since Scorpios avoid close combat, engaging them at melee range can neutralize their ranged attacks
  * **Stun Effects**: Abilities that interrupt action can make Scorpios vulnerable during approach
  * **Blocking**: Use of obstacles like pillars can block their ranged attacks
  * **AoE Effects**: Area of effect abilities can be effective as they try to run from the hero
  * **Blessed Enchant**: Particularly effective on melee weapons as it negates their damage resistance
  * **Disruption**: Their retreat behavior can be exploited by keeping them from getting to optimal firing positions

==== Locations ====
  * Found in the underground levels of the dungeon
  * More commonly encountered in later levels of the dungeon

==== Resistances ====
  * **Leech Enchantment**: Immune to damage amplification from Leech-enchanted weapons
  * **Poison**: Immune to poison effects
  * **Melee**: Prefers to avoid melee range combat
