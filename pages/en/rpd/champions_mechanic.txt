====== Champions Mechanic ======

**Champions** are special enhanced versions of regular mobs that appear in the later levels of Remixed Dungeon with improved stats and abilities.

==== Description ====
Champions are elite variants of regular enemies that have enhanced stats and unique properties. They are more difficult to defeat than regular enemies but provide greater challenge and rewards.

==== Types of Champions ====
There are several types of champions distinguished by their properties:

  * **Fire Champion**: Immune to [[en:rpd:fire|fire]] and [[en:rpd:burning_buff|burning]], resists damage from fire-based sources
  * **Frost Champion**: Immune to cold effects and freezing, resists cold-based damage
  * **Shock Champion**: Immune to electricity and paralysis, resists shock-based damage
  * **Blast Champion**: Immune to knockback effects and stunning, resistant to explosion damage
  * **Displace Champion**: Has a chance to blink away when attacked
  * **Ward Champion**: Gains temporary armor when attacked
  * **Soul Champion**: Heals when it takes damage
  * **Bewitch Champion**: Can charm enemies and turn them to its side
  * **Snake Champion**: Has higher evasion and accuracy

==== Properties ====
  * **Enhanced Stats**: Generally have higher HP, damage, accuracy, and evasion than regular variants
  * **Immunities**: Each type has specific immunities based on their nature
  * **Resistances**: Enhanced resistance to effects matching their type
  * **Increased Difficulty**: Appear only in deeper levels of the dungeon
  * **Visual Markers**: Often have distinctive visual indicators to identify them as champions

==== Mechanics ====
  * Champions appear more frequently as the player progresses deeper into the dungeon
  * Each champion type has specific resistances and immunities that make them harder to defeat with certain tactics
  * Champions may have special abilities that activate under certain conditions
  * They provide more experience and better loot than regular mobs of the same type

==== Tactics ====
  * **Fire Champions**: Use non-fire damage sources, avoid fire traps or spells
  * **Frost Champions**: Use frost-based attacks sparingly, focus on other damage types
  * **Shock Champions**: Avoid electrical attacks as they may be resisted
  * **Displace Champions**: Expect them to move unpredictably when attacked
  * **General**: Use status effects they're not immune to, exploit non-typed damage sources
