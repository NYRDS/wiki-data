  * Identified potions keep their appearance for the remainder of the game
  * Some classes have special identification abilities

==== Mechanics ====
  * Potions can be consumed directly or thrown/shattered on the ground
  * When thrown, the effect occurs at the location where the potion breaks
  * Some potions have different effects when drunk vs. when shattered
  * Potions can be used to moisten arrows, scrolls, and other items in certain combinations
  * Most potions have a base price of 40 gold when identified

==== Strategy ====
  * Identify potions safely when possible before using them
  * Consider throwing potions to affect enemies rather than drinking them
  * Some potions are more valuable for their utility than direct consumption
  * Potions can be used defensively to create barriers or escape situations
