====== Ring of Strength ======

**Note:** This item appears to be obsolete or was removed from the current version of Remixed Dungeon. A Ring of Strength does not exist in the current game codebase as of the most recent version.

==== Historical Context ====
The Ring of Strength was likely a ring item that increased the wearer's effective strength by 1 point, allowing access to equipment with higher strength requirements. This functionality may now be provided by other items or mechanics in the game.

==== Current Strength-Related Items ====
  * [[en:rpd:potion_of_might_item|Potion of Might]] - Permanently increases strength by 1 point (may be the successor to this item)
  * [[en:rpd:ring_of_might_item|Ring of Might]] - Another potential strength-boosting ring (if available)
  * [[en:rpd:strength_attribute|Strength]] - General information about strength mechanics

==== Verification ====
This page has been marked as obsolete because an extensive search of the current codebase reveals no trace of a RingOfStrength.java file or any corresponding string resources. The item appears to have been removed in a past update.
