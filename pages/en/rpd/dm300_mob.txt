The DM-300 (Dwarf Machine Model 300) is a major boss in Remixed Dungeon. This massive mechanical construct was built by the dwarves several centuries ago for mining operations in the deep caves. After the decline of the Dwarven Metropolis, it has become a guardian of the caves that attacks any intruders.

==== Description ====
This mechanical walker features a rocket launcher for a left arm and a roll of barbed wire for a right arm. It is too dangerous to approach and too important to destroy, according to the game's description. DM-300 represents the pinnacle of dwarven engineering before they shifted to magical entities.
