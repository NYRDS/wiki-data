====== Potion ======

Potions are consumable items in Remixed Dungeon that provide various beneficial or detrimental effects when consumed.

==== Description ====
Potions are single-use items that provide a variety of effects when consumed. Most potions must be identified before their effects are known, though some provide immediate feedback when drunk.

==== Mechanics ====
  * Potions must often be identified before their effect is known
  * Most potions become identified when consumed
  * Some potions can be thrown to affect enemies or other characters
  * Thrown potions generally affect only the tile they land on
  * Shattering potions on the ground can provide alternative effects

==== Identification ====
Potions come unidentified and must be sampled to determine their effect. This can be done by:
  * Drinking the potion
  * Throwing it at an enemy or ally to see the effect
  * Using certain items or spells that identify items

==== Strategy ====
  * Identifying potions early can save resources and avoid dangerous effects
  * Some potions, like healing, are always safe to drink when needed
  * Throwing potions at enemies can be tactically useful
  * Consider saving important potions for critical moments
