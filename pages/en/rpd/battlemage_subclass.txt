==== Description ====
The Battle Mage is a subclass for the Mage hero class in Remixed Dungeon. When fighting with a wand in hand, the _Battle Mage_ inflicts additional damage depending on the current number of charges. Every successful hit restores 1 charge to this wand.

==== Abilities ====
  * **Wand Damage:** Additional damage equal to wand's current charges
  * **Wand Charging:** Every successful hit restores 1 charge to the equipped wand
  * **Combat Magic:** Combines magical and melee combat effectively

==== Specialization ====
  * Focuses on weaponized magic use with wands
  * Utilizes wands as both magical tools and combat weapons
  * Combines casting with physical combat through wand enhancement

==== Lore ====
The Battle Mage subclass represents the warrior-mages of fantasy lore, who have mastered the art of using magic as a direct weapon in combat rather than just for utility.

==== Acquisition ====
The Battle Mage subclass can be unlocked by reading a Tome of Mastery after defeating the second boss, Tengu. It's only available to the Mage hero class.

==== Equipment ====
  * Special armor: [[en:rpd:battle_mage_armor_item|Battle Mage Armor]] can be obtained using an [[en:rpd:armor_kit_item|Armor Kit]] on any regular armor
  * Preferred items: Wands, weapon-specific scrolls, combat-enhancing rings

==== Strategy ====
  * Focus on using wands as weapons in addition to their normal functions
  * Maintain wand charges through successful hits to keep damage high
  * Build toward a magic-focused combat style using wand synergies
  * Leverage the wand damage bonus which scales with current charges
