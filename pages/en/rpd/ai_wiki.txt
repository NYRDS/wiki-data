====== AI Tools for Wiki Maintenance ======

This page documents automated tools and suggestions for maintaining the Remixed Dungeon wiki, particularly for AI and automated systems to help with maintenance tasks.

==== Automated Tools ====

**Python-based Tools** (Located in ''tools/py-tools/'' directory):
  * ''find_red_links.py'' - Identifies internal wiki links that point to non-existent pages (redlinks)
  * ''scale_sprites_for_wiki.py'' - Processes game sprites for wiki use with proper scaling and borders
  * ''check_broken_images.py'' - Verifies that all images referenced in wiki pages exist
  * ''dokuwiki_linter.py'' - Validates DokuWiki syntax and identifies potential formatting issues

==== AI-Targeted Documentation ====

**Machine-Readable Data:**
  * The ''mr:'' namespace contains machine-readable reference pages
  * These pages contain raw data about entities extracted from source code
  * Created for different entity types: mobs, items, spells, etc.

**Entity Tracking:**
  * AI systems should track entity relationships across the codebase
  * Information sources: Java classes, Lua scripts, JSON configs, string resources
  * Cross-reference ''getEntityKind()'' method results with file names

==== Recommended Tools for AI Systems ====

  * **Static Analysis**: Tools that scan code for entities and their properties
  * **Wiki Link Validation**: Automated checking of internal links
  * **Content Freshness**: Tools to identify pages that haven't been updated in a long time
  * **Naming Consistency**: Validation that page names follow the convention ''{entity_name}_{type}'' (e.g., ''tengu_mob'', ''ankh_item'')

==== Potential Tool Ideas ====

The following tools would be beneficial for wiki maintenance:

  * ''entity_extractor.py'' - Automatically extract entity data from Java/Lua/JSON files and suggest wiki page content
  * ''page_updater.py'' - Compare existing wiki pages with current code and suggest updates
  * ''translation_validator.py'' - Verify that pages in different languages contain consistent information
  * ''link_suggester.py'' - Suggest relevant pages that should be linked together
  * ''naming_consistency_checker.py'' - Check for pages that don't follow the proper naming convention and suggest renames
  * ''content_verifier.py'' - Automatically verify game mechanics information against source code and flag outdated content
  * ''redlink_resolver.py'' - Automatically create new pages for redlinks based on available code data
  * ''multilingual_content_sync.py'' - Ensure consistency of content across different language versions of the same page

==== Automation Guidelines ====

When implementing AI-based wiki maintenance:

  * Verify all information against the actual source code before updating
  * Maintain consistency in naming conventions across all pages
  * Preserve the existing formatting and structure when possible
  * When creating new pages, follow the established template for that entity type
  * Include references to the source code that confirms the information

==== Detailed Tool Recommendations ====

**Content Analysis Tools:**
  * ''string_resource_analyzer.py'' - Analyze string resources across different languages to ensure consistency and completeness
  * ''image_reference_checker.py'' - Verify that all referenced images exist and are properly named
  * ''tag_validator.py'' - Ensure all pages have appropriate tags and that tags are consistent across similar entities

**Quality Assurance Tools:**
  * ''fact_checker.py'' - Cross-reference wiki content with codebase to detect inconsistencies
  * ''duplicate_content_detector.py'' - Identify duplicated information across different pages
  * ''content_gap_analyzer.py'' - Identify entities that exist in the game but don't have wiki pages

**Localization Enhancement Tools:**
  * ''auto_translation_suggester.py'' - Suggest translations based on string resources and existing localized pages
  * ''completeness_tracker.py'' - Track which pages exist in which languages and identify missing translations

==== Existing Code References ====

  * For Java code: Reference the specific classes and methods that define entity behavior
  * For Lua scripts: Include the specific files that implement custom mechanics
  * For JSON configs: Reference the exact files and fields that contain the configuration data
  * For string resources: Include links to the string definitions in various languages

==== Additional Tool Suggestions ====

**Automated Verification Tools:**
  * ''spell_check_wiki.py'' - Perform spell-checking and grammar validation across all wiki pages
  * ''link_health_checker.py'' - Verify that all external links are still valid and accessible
  * ''image_size_optimizer.py'' - Optimize image sizes and formats for better wiki performance
  * ''consistency_checker.py'' - Verify consistent formatting and DokuWiki syntax across pages

**AI Enhancement Tools:**
  * ''auto_content_updater.py'' - Automatically update wiki pages when corresponding code changes are detected
  * ''summary_generator.py'' - Create automatic summaries of changes made to wiki pages
  * ''entity_relationship_mapper.py'' - Create visual maps of relationships between different game entities
  * ''template_generator.py'' - Automatically create template pages for new entity types based on existing patterns

**Workflow Improvement Tools:**
  * ''multi_language_sync.py'' - Synchronize updates across language versions of wiki pages
  * ''merge_conflict_resolver.py'' - Automatically handle merge conflicts in wiki content
  * ''version_diff_analyzer.py'' - Highlight differences when wiki pages are updated
  * ''validation_report_generator.py'' - Create reports of all verification checks and their status

**Content Enhancement Tools:**
  * ''stat_extractor.py'' - Extract statistics from game code and automatically format them for wiki pages
  * ''code_comment_linker.py'' - Link wiki explanations to relevant comments in source code
  * ''example_generator.py'' - Create game scenario examples based on code mechanics
  * ''cross_reference_builder.py'' - Build automatic cross-references between related wiki pages
