====== AI Tools for Wiki Maintenance ======

This page documents automated tools and suggestions for maintaining the Remixed Dungeon wiki, particularly for AI and automated systems to help with maintenance tasks.

==== Automated Tools ====

**Python-based Tools** (Located in ''tools/py-tools/'' directory):
  * ''find_red_links.py'' - Identifies internal wiki links that point to non-existent pages (redlinks)
  * ''scale_sprites_for_wiki.py'' - Processes game sprites for wiki use with proper scaling and borders
  * ''check_broken_images.py'' - Verifies that all images referenced in wiki pages exist
  * ''dokuwiki_linter.py'' - Validates DokuWiki syntax and identifies potential formatting issues

==== AI-Targeted Documentation ====

**Machine-Readable Data:**
  * The ''mr:'' namespace contains machine-readable reference pages
  * These pages contain raw data about entities extracted from source code
  * Created for different entity types: mobs, items, spells, etc.

**Entity Tracking:**
  * AI systems should track entity relationships across the codebase
  * Information sources: Java classes, Lua scripts, JSON configs, string resources
  * Cross-reference ''getEntityKind()'' method results with file names

==== Recommended Tools for AI Systems ====

  * **Static Analysis**: Tools that scan code for entities and their properties
  * **Wiki Link Validation**: Automated checking of internal links
  * **Content Freshness**: Tools to identify pages that haven't been updated in a long time
  * **Naming Consistency**: Validation that page names follow the convention ''{entity_name}_{type}'' (e.g., ''tengu_mob'', ''ankh_item'')

==== Potential Tool Ideas ====

The following tools would be beneficial for wiki maintenance:

  * ''entity_extractor.py'' - Automatically extract entity data from Java/Lua/JSON files and suggest wiki page content
  * ''page_updater.py'' - Compare existing wiki pages with current code and suggest updates
  * ''translation_validator.py'' - Verify that pages in different languages contain consistent information
  * ''link_suggester.py'' - Suggest relevant pages that should be linked together

==== Automation Guidelines ====

When implementing AI-based wiki maintenance:

  * Verify all information against the actual source code before updating
  * Maintain consistency in naming conventions across all pages
  * Preserve the existing formatting and structure when possible
  * When creating new pages, follow the established template for that entity type
  * Include references to the source code that confirms the information

==== Existing Code References ====

  * For Java code: Reference the specific classes and methods that define entity behavior
  * For Lua scripts: Include the specific files that implement custom mechanics
  * For JSON configs: Reference the exact files and fields that contain the configuration data
  * For string resources: Include links to the string definitions in various languages
