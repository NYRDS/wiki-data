====== AI Wiki Page - Tools and Suggestions ======

This page documents suggestions for additional tools that would be helpful for AI agents and developers maintaining the Remixed Dungeon wiki.

==== Current Tooling Issues ====

  * **Large Output Truncation**: Several commands, particularly the redlink checker, produce large outputs that get truncated, preventing complete analysis
  * **Incomplete Code References**: While current pages include many code references, there's inconsistency in which code files are referenced
  * **Missing Automated Checks**: No automated tooling to check for missing mr: namespace pages

==== Suggested Additional Tools ====

  * **MR Namespace Generator**:
    - A script that automatically generates missing mr: namespace pages based on entity lists
    - Should be able to scan the codebase and generate basic pages with code references
    - Should follow the pattern: {entity_name}_{type} (e.g., skeleton_mob, ankh_item, heal_spell, burning_buff)

  * **Auto-Linker Tool**:
    - A script that identifies terms in wiki pages that have corresponding wiki pages and adds appropriate links
    - Should avoid creating duplicate links
    - Should be configurable to follow the proper naming conventions

  * **Content Consistency Checker**:
    - Validates that all wiki pages follow the established format
    - Checks for proper code references in "Code References" sections
    - Verifies that pages contain appropriate DokuWiki syntax

  * **Statistics Generator**:
    - Provides metrics on wiki completeness (coverage of game entities)
    - Tracks pages that lack code references
    - Monitors update frequency and outdated content

  * **Automated Redlink Resolver**:
    - More sophisticated than current redlink checker
    - Suggests similar pages that might have been intended
    - Provides templates for creation of missing pages

  * **Code Change Tracker**:
    - Tool that monitors git changes in the codebase
    - Suggests wiki pages that might need updates based on code changes
    - Could be integrated into CI/CD to flag potential documentation gaps

==== Possible Implementation Approach ====

  * **Python-based Utilities**:
    - Extend existing tools in the tools/py-tools directory
    - Use AST parsing to extract more detailed information from Java/Lua files
    - Implement NLP techniques to identify potential linking candidates

  * **JSON Config Generation**:
    - Tool to extract string references and configuration settings from JSON files
    - Auto-generates content for pages based on these configurations
    - Helps ensure data consistency between game and wiki

  * **Visual Diff Tool**:
    - Shows differences between game behavior and wiki documentation
    - Could use screenshots or other visual aids to highlight discrepancies

==== Implementation Priority ====

  1. **MR Namespace Generator** - Addresses the most glaring information gap
  2. **Auto-Linker Tool** - Would significantly improve navigation and cross-referencing
  3. **Content Consistency Checker** - Ensures quality and uniformity
  4. **Statistics Generator** - Provides visibility into wiki completeness
  5. **Automated Redlink Resolver** - Enhancement of existing functionality
  6. **Code Change Tracker** - Advanced feature for ongoing maintenance

==== Additional Resources Needed ====

  * **Entity Database**:
    - A comprehensive list of all in-game entities (mobs, items, spells, buffs, etc.)
    - Should be generated from code/config files to ensure completeness
    - Would serve as a checklist for wiki completeness

  * **Game Data API**:
    - A standardized way to extract game data for documentation
    - Would make it easier to auto-generate parts of wiki pages
    - Could also serve the game client for in-game help or tooltips

  * **Template System**:
    - Template files for different types of wiki pages
    - Would ensure consistency while making creation of new pages easier
    - Templates should be easily customizable but enforce essential sections

This page should be updated regularly as new tooling needs become apparent during wiki maintenance.
