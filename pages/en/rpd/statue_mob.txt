====== Statue ======

{{ rpd:images:statue_sprite.png|Statue Sprite }}

==== Description ====
You would think that it's just another ugly statue of this dungeon, but its red glowing eyes give itself away. While the statue itself is made of stone, the weapon it's wielding looks real. According to the in-game description: "You would think that it's just another ugly statue of this dungeon, but its red glowing eyes give itself away. While the statue itself is made of stone, the _%s_, it's wielding, looks real."

==== Item Class ====
  * **Java Class:** [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/watabou/pixeldungeon/actors/mobs/Statue.java|Statue.java]]
  * **Sprite:** Generated dynamically based on the weapon it carries

==== Stats ====
  * **HP:** 15 + (5 × dungeon depth)
  * **HT:** 15 + (5 × dungeon depth)
  * **Defense Skill:** 4 + dungeon depth
  * **Attack Skill:** 4 + dungeon depth
  * **Damage:** (dungeon depth / 4 + 1) to dungeon depth
  * **EXP for Kill:** 0
  * **Carcass Chance:** 0

==== Behavior ====
  * **Passive Nature:** The statue is normally passive and will not attack first
  * **Aggro Trigger:** Becomes hostile when attacked, when area of effect items like [[en:rpd:corpse_dust_item|Corpse Dust]] are used nearby, or when other hostile actions are taken
  * **Immunities:** Immune to [[en:rpd:toxic_gas|Toxic Gas]], [[en:rpd:poison_buff|Poison]], [[en:rpd:bleeding_buff|Bleeding]], and [[en:rpd:leech_enchantment|Leech]] status effects
  * **Resistances:** Resistant to [[en:rpd:death_enchantment|Death enchantment]] and [[en:rpd:scroll_of_psionic_blast|Scroll of Psionic Blast]]
  * **Movement:** Does not follow the player around the dungeon (doesn't beckon)

==== Equipment ====
  * **Weapon:** Carries a random weapon from the current dungeon level's treasure pool
  * **Weapon Properties:** Weapon will be level 0 or higher, melee type, identified, and enchanted with a random enchantment
  * **Strength Requirement:** Statue's strength is adjusted to match the required strength of the weapon it carries
  * **Weapon Drop:** Guarantees dropping its weapon upon death (100% drop rate)

==== Habitat ====
  * Found in locked or barricaded rooms throughout the dungeon
  * Commonly encountered in "statue rooms" which are special room types
  * More likely to appear on deeper dungeon levels due to scaling stats

==== Strategy ====
  * Since the statue is passive, you can often avoid combat by not attacking it or using rage-inducing items nearby
  * If you do engage, be aware that its damage scales with dungeon depth
  * The guaranteed weapon drop makes it valuable for loot, especially if it carries a high-tier weapon with good enchantments
  * Magic damage and ranged attacks can be effective since the statue has no special magic resistance beyond its resistances listed above
  * Be careful when using Scroll of Rage as it will break the statue's passive behavior

==== Variants ====
  * [[en:rpd:armored_statue_mob|Armored Statue]] - A variant that carries armor instead of a weapon
  * [[en:rpd:golden_statue_mob|Golden Statue]] - A rare variant that always carries a Golden Sword +4
