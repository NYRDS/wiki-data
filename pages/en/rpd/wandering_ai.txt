====== Wandering AI ======

==== Description ====
Wandering AI is an artificial intelligence behavior where enemies move randomly around the dungeon rather than actively pursuing the player.

==== Characteristics ====
  * **Random Movement** - Moves to adjacent tiles randomly when not engaged
  * **Low Alertness** - Doesn't actively search for the player
  * **Patrol Behavior** - May follow simple patterns when undisturbed
  * **Passive Detection** - Only notices player when in adjacent tiles or line of sight

  * [[en:rpd:gnoll_mob|Gnoll]] - Sometimes found wandering in groups
  * [[en:rpd:kobold_mob|Kobold]] - Often wanders near resource areas

==== Advantages ====
  * **Predictable Movement** - Easier to anticipate their position
  * **Less Threatening** - Won't pursue the player aggressively
  * **Opportunity for Preparation** - Can prepare for combat before engagement

==== Disadvantages ====
  * **Surprise Factor** - May encounter when not expecting combat
  * **Stealth Limitations** - Even stealthy characters may be detected
  * **Area Coverage** - May detect the player over larger areas when multiple present

==== Strategy ====
  * **Avoidance** - Often possible to avoid combat by careful movement
