====== Glyph of Affection ======

The Glyph of Affection is an [[en:rpd:armor_glyphs|armor glyph]] that can appear on certain types of armor in Remixed Dungeon. This glyph provides charm-based defensive abilities to the wearer.

==== Description ====
When an enemy hits the wearer of armor with this glyph, there is a chance that the attacker will become charmed, turning to fight alongside the hero for a limited time.

==== Mechanics ====
  * **Activation:** Triggers when the wearer is hit by an enemy
  * **Effect:** Chance to charm the attacking enemy
  * **Duration:** Charmed enemies fight alongside the hero temporarily
  * **Probability:** Chance depends on the level of the armor and other factors
  * **Limitations:** May not affect certain types of enemies (like mindless undead or constructs)

==== Armor Compatibility ====
  * Can appear on certain types of armor that support glyphs
  * More likely to appear on armor with higher strength requirements
  * Cannot be applied to cloth armor or armor without glyph slots

==== Strategy ====
  * Effective in groups of enemies, as charmed enemies will fight other enemies
  * Particularly useful against difficult single enemies
  * Be careful in situations where you don't want to lose control of the battlefield
  * Works well with crowd control strategies

==== Identification ====
  * Armor with this glyph appears as normal until activated
  * Can be identified through various means like [[en:rpd:scroll_of_identify_item|Scroll of Identify]]

==== Acquisition ====
  * [[en:rpd:armor|Armor]] randomly generated with this glyph
