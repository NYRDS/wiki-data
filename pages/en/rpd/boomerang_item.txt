When thrown at an enemy, the Boomerang strikes for 1-4 damage and then returns to the player's inventory, ready to be used again. This makes it a reliable ranged option that doesn't require ammunition or concern about running out of uses.

According to the game's string resources: "This throwing weapon returns to the hands of a thrower after hitting a target or missing. Due to its special balanced design, the boomerang can be thrown slightly faster than other weapons of the same weight."
