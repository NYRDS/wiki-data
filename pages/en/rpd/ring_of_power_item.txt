The **Ring of Power** is a ring in Remixed Dungeon that affects the power of wands when worn.

==== Description ====
The Ring of Power influences the energy field around the wearer, making wands more powerful. This is particularly useful for characters who rely on wands for combat and utility purposes. However, degraded rings of power will have the opposite effect, weakening wand power instead. Like all rings, it requires identification to reveal its specific properties.

==== Effects ====
  * **Wand Enhancement:** Increases the effectiveness of wands
  * **Energy Field:** Creates an energy field that enhances magical items
  * **Degradation Effect:** Lower quality rings will weaken wands instead
  * **Identification:** Like other rings, requires time to identify while worn

==== Stats ====
  * **Effect Type:** Passive wand enhancement
  * **Upgradeable:** Can be upgraded with scrolls of upgrade
  * **Degradation:** Quality affects the ring's effect (positive when upgraded, negative when degraded)
  * **Rarity:** Rare (appears less frequently than other rings)

==== Strategy ====
  * **Early Game:** May be less useful if you haven't obtained wands yet
  * **Mid Game:** Becomes valuable when you start using wands regularly
  * **Late Game:** Essential for wand-focused characters
  * **Pairing:** Works well with other rings of utility

==== Acquisition ====
  * **Random Drops:** Found as random drops from mobs
  * **Chests:** May appear in various chests throughout the dungeon
  * **NPCs:** Sometimes sold by shopkeepers or other NPCs
  * **Upgrading:** Can be improved with scrolls of upgrade
