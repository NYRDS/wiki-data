{{ rpd:images:chaos_bow_item.png|Chaos Bow }}

The **Chaos Bow** is a unique ranged weapon with chaotic properties and self-upgrading mechanics. It is part of the [[en:rpd:chaos_set_item|Chaos Set]].

==== Description ====
The Chaos Bow is a tier-3 ranged weapon that is filled with the power of Chaos. Each arrow it shoots will carry a piece of chaos energy within it. The bow has special mechanics where it can both upgrade and degrade based on combat performance.

==== Stats ====
  * **Tier:** 3
  * **Strength Required:** 14
  * **Damage:** Based on level (dmgFactor function: base damage * (1 + level * 0.3))
  * **Accuracy:** 1.0
  * **Evasion:** 1.0
  * **Upgradable:** No (upgrades are handled automatically)

==== Special Mechanics ====
  * **Self-Upgrading:** The bow upgrades itself when the owner does damage, with charge increasing on successful hits
  * **Self-Degrading:** If unused for too long, the bow degrades and loses levels
  * **Chaos Mark:** On missing a target, the bow triggers a Chaos Mark at the user's position
  * **Charge System:** Each hit adds to the bow's charge, and reaching charge threshold triggers an upgrade
  * **Level 6+ Degradation:** At level 6 and above, if the charge reaches 0, the bow degrades, losing its enchantment

==== Usage ====
The Chaos Bow is effective for players who engage in combat regularly, as it requires active use to maintain its effectiveness. Its chaotic properties make it a powerful but demanding weapon.

==== Classes ====
While any class can technically use the Chaos Bow, it works best with classes that have strong ranged combat capabilities.

==== Strategy ====
  * Use frequently to maintain the weapon's level and enchantments
  * Be aware of the self-degradation mechanic if you're not using it often
  * The Chaos Mark effect on missing can be dangerous, so aim carefully
  * The bow's damage increases significantly with each level
