====== Chaos Bow ======

{{ rpd:images:chaos_bow_item.png|Chaos Bow }}

The **Chaos Bow** is a unique ranged weapon with chaotic properties and self-upgrading mechanics. It is part of the [[en:rpd:chaos_set_item|Chaos Set]].

==== Description ====
The Chaos Bow is a tier-3 ranged weapon that is filled with the power of Chaos. Each arrow it shoots will carry a piece of chaos energy within it. The bow has special mechanics where it can both upgrade and degrade based on combat performance.

==== Stats ====
  * **Tier:** 3
  * **Accuracy:** 1.0
  * **Delay:** 1.0
  * **Damage:** Based on level (dmgFactor function: 1 + level * 0.3)
  * **Image File:** items/chaosBow.png
  * **Upgradable:** No (upgrades are handled automatically)

==== Special Mechanics ====
  * **Self-Upgrading:** The bow upgrades itself when the owner does damage, with charge += 1 on successful hits
  * **Charge Threshold:** Upgrades when charge > chargeForLevel() where chargeForLevel() = (int)(5 * Math.pow(level(), 1.5))
  * **Self-Degrading:** Charge decreases by 1 when owner takes damage (never goes below 0)
  * **Level 6+ Degradation:** At level 6 and above, if the charge reaches 0, the bow degrades, losing its enchantment
  * **Chaos Mark:** On missing a target, the bow triggers Chaos Mark at the user's position with intensity: charge + 3*level()
  * **Image Selection:** Image varies based on level (image = Math.max(0, Math.min(level()/3, 4)))
  * **Damage Calculation:** Damage factor increases with level according to formula: 1 + level() * 0.3

==== Code Mechanics ====
The ChaosBow extends the Bow class and implements several override methods:
  * **ownerDoesDamage()**: Increases charge when the owner does damage
  * **ownerTakesDamage()**: Decreases charge when the owner takes damage, handles degradation at level 6+
  * **dmgFactor()**: Calculates damage multiplier based on level
  * **onMiss()**: Triggers Chaos Mark when the bow misses
  * **isUpgradable()**: Returns false to prevent manual upgrades
  * **restoreFromBundle()**: Handles saving/loading with proper image selection

==== Usage ====
The Chaos Bow is effective for players who engage in combat regularly, as it requires active use to maintain its effectiveness. Its chaotic properties make it a powerful but demanding weapon.

==== Classes ====
While any class can technically use the Chaos Bow, it works best with classes that have strong ranged combat capabilities.

==== Strategy ====
  * Use frequently to maintain the weapon's level and enchantments
  * Be aware of the self-degradation mechanic if you're not using it often
  * The Chaos Mark effect on missing can be dangerous, so aim carefully
  * The bow's damage increases significantly with each level
  * Higher levels require more charges to upgrade (chargeForLevel grows with level^1.5)
