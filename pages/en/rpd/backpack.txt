====== Backpack ======

{{ rpd:images:scrollholder_sprite.png|Backpack }}

The **backpack** represents the hero's inventory capacity in Remixed Dungeon. It determines how many items the hero can carry before becoming overencumbered.

==== Description ====
The backpack is the hero's main inventory system where items such as potions, scrolls, food, equipment, keys, and other items are stored. The size is fixed and cannot be upgraded, so managing inventory space is a key aspect of gameplay.

==== Capacity ====
  * **Standard Size:** The hero can carry a limited number of items
  * **No Expansion:** Backpack size cannot be increased
  * **Encumbrance:** Carrying too many items can affect movement speed
  * **Weight System:** Some items are heavier than others
