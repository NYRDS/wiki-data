{{ rpd:images:spider_egg_mob.png|Spider Egg }}

==== Description ====
Spider Egg is a passive mob in Remixed Dungeon that eventually hatches into a random spider after 20 turns. Spider Eggs are laid by the Spider Queen and have a limited lifespan before hatching. They represent locations where spiders lay eggs or where young spiders appear.

==== Stats ====

  * **Level**: 9 (Max)
  * **Defense Skill**: 1

  * **Loot Chance**: 20% for a random seed

==== Abilities ====
  * **Hatching**: Automatically hatches into a random spider after 20 turns
  * **Immobilization**: Cannot move from its position
  * **Fragility**: Very low HP, easily destroyed
  * **Pet Immunity**: Cannot be tamed or made into a pet (canBePet() returns false)

==== Behavior ====
  * **Immobile**: Remains in place until destroyed or hatched
  * **Hatch Timer**: Automatically hatches after 20 turns through the act() method
  * **Spawning**: Upon hatching, creates a random spider using MobSpawner
  * **Destruction**: If killed before hatching, is destroyed without spawning a spider
  * **Loot**: Has a 20% chance to drop a random seed when destroyed
  * **Location**: Most commonly found on Spider Nest levels and infested areas of the dungeon

==== Drops ====
  * **Seeds**: 20% chance for a random seed when destroyed
  * **Nothing**: Otherwise

==== Strategy ====
  * **Immediate Threat**: Though fragile, presents a threat as it will soon hatch into a spider
  * **Timing**: You can choose to destroy it immediately to prevent a spider from spawning, or allow it to hatch when you're prepared
  * **Advantage**: If you have means to tame or control spiders, allowing it to hatch might be advantageous
  * **Seed Farming**: Has a 20% chance to drop a seed when destroyed, which can be useful
  * **Avoid Clustering**: Be careful that multiple eggs don't hatch nearby, creating a spider swarm
  * **Spider Population**: Consider the existing spider population in the area when deciding to destroy or allow hatching
