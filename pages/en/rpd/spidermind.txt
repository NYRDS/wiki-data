{{ rpd:images:spidermind_sprite.png|Psi-Spider }}

The **Psi-Spider** (also known as SpiderMind) is a special type of spider mob found in the Spider Nest area of the dungeon. It possesses unique mental powers that allow it to support nearby friendly mobs with beneficial buffs.

==== Description ====
These apparently fragile spiders have unique mental powers that allow them to control the entire colony. Psi-Spiders are capable of controlling any living creature, but they are quite cowardly.

==== Stats ====
  * **HP:** 5
  * **Max HP:** 5
  * **Attack Skill:** 10
  * **Defense Skill:** 1
  * **Damage:** 0-0 (does no direct damage)
  * **Damage Reduction:** 0
  * **Speed:** 1.0x normal speed
  * **EXP for Kill:** 6
  * **Maximum Level:** 9
  * **Loot:** Mystery Meat (6.7% chance)

==== Special Mechanics ====
  * **Ranged Attack Only:** The Psi-Spider can only perform ranged attacks (cannot make direct melee attacks)
  * **Buff Casting:** When attacking, applies beneficial buffs to nearby friendly mobs
  * **Buff Types:** Randomly applies one of: Speed, Barkskin, Blessed, Health (Sungrass), Armor (Earthroot), ManaShield, or Fury
  * **Duration:** Applied buffs last for 3 turns
  * **Cowardly AI:** Tends to keep distance from enemies when in hunting state, preferring to stay away from combat

==== Behavior ====
  * Prefers to keep distance from enemies when engaged in combat
  * Uses psychic powers to support allies rather than dealing direct damage
  * Will try to stay behind other mobs for protection
  * Only supports friendly mobs that it can see
  * When hunting, moves away from the target (getFurther) instead of getting closer

==== Strategy ====
  * The Psi-Spider is not dangerous on its own as it deals no direct damage
  * However, it can significantly strengthen other nearby enemies with its buffs
  * Focus on eliminating them quickly before they can support other mobs
  * Due to their cowardly nature, they will try to retreat from combat
  * They're particularly dangerous when grouped with other powerful enemies

==== Location ====
Psi-Spiders can be found in the Spider Nest sub-levels (6s-10s), with spawn rates:
  * Level 8s: Spawn rate of 0.2
  * Level 9s: Spawn rate of 0.3
  * Level 10s: Spawn rate of 0.5
