====== Scroll of Curse ======

{{ rpd:images:scroll_of_curse_item.png|Scroll of Curse }}

==== Description ====
This scroll was specially created to punish thieves stupid enough to try to use magic they can't understand. 

This magic scroll is totally useless and even harmful for regular adventurer, but pretty well valued by merchants.

==== Mechanics ====
When read, the Scroll of Curse:
  * Removes any existing Invisibility from the reader
  * Produces curse particles and plays a cursed sound
  * Applies a random negative buff for 10 turns:
    * [[en:rpd:blindness_buff|Blindness]]
    * [[en:rpd:charm_buff|Charm]]
    * [[en:rpd:roots_buff|Roots]]
    * [[en:rpd:slow_buff|Slow]]
    * [[en:rpd:vertigo_buff|Vertigo]]
    * [[en:rpd:weakness_buff|Weakness]]
  * Curses all currently equipped items
  * Costs 1 turn to read

==== Pricing ====
  * Base price: 300 gold (when identified)
  * Unidentified price: follows normal scroll pricing

==== Strategy ====
  * Generally avoid using unless you have special protections
  * Valuable for merchants who buy items (sell before use to avoid curse)
  * Can potentially be used strategically in specific situations
