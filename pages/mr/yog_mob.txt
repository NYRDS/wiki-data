<string name="Yog_Aliases">Old God</string>
<string name="Yog_Desc">Yog-Dzewa is an Old God, an immensely powerful otherworldly being. Even though it lies bound at the bottom of the dungeon, its mere presence blights the area around it, turning the Distant Gardens into a wasteland. You can feel the weight of its attention, and your heart quickens just from being in its presence.\n\nYog-Dzewa's attack patterns are complex - it uses its eye organs to attack in straight lines, spreads toxic gas, and will summon many larvae during the fight. This is a truly epic encounter.\n\nIt has five organs - the eyes, brain, heart, teeth, and two fists. These all must be defeated to damage Yog directly - and it will quickly heal them when they fall.</string>
