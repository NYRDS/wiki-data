====== Regeneration Buff - Code References ======

===== Java Classes =====
  * [[https://github.com/NYRDS/remixed-dungeon/blob/master/RemixedDungeon/src/main/java/com/watabou/pixeldungeon/actors/buffs/Regeneration.java|Regeneration.java]]

===== Code Implementation =====
This buff handles natural health regeneration for characters. The regeneration rate is affected by other buffs via regenerationBonus() method and can be modified by game facilitions (FAST_REGENERATION).

===== Key Properties =====
  * **Base Regeneration Delay**: 10 turns (REGENERATION_DELAY constant)
  * **Heal Rate Formula**: (float) Math.pow(1.2, bonus[0]) where bonus is accumulated from other buffs
  * **Fast Regeneration Facilitation**: Adds +10 to the bonus when FAST_REGENERATION is enabled and the target is a hero
  * **Safe Level Condition**: Regeneration does not occur on safe levels (when target.level().isSafe() is true)
  * **Starving Condition**: Regeneration does not occur when the target is starving (target.isStarving())

===== Method Details =====
  * **act()**: Main action method that handles the regeneration process, calculates healing points based on bonuses, and schedules the next regeneration
  * **attachTo()**: Overrides the default behavior to check if the target already has regeneration buff level > 0
