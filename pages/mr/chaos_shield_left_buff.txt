**Chaos Shield Item:**
  * Java Class: Not directly found (may be implemented differently)
  * String Resources: 
    - `ChaosShield_name` - "Chaos Shield"
    - `ChaosShield_desc` - "The Chaos Shield is the result of fusing a Chaos Crystal with ordinary shield, causing it to manifest random chaotic effects upon a successful block."

  * Chaos Crystal effect application code
  * Combat damage resolution with shield mechanics
