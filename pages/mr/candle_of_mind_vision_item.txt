<string name="CandleOfMindVision_Name">Candle Of Visions</string>
<string name="CandleOfMindVision_Info">Looks like a regular candle, not something you would expect to find in a dangerous dungeon. Weirdly enough it\'s rather warm to the touch, despite the fact that it wasn\'t lit yet.</string>
<string name="CandleOfMindVision_Info_Lighted">The candle lighted up the moment you took it out of your backpack. The flame emits a faint purple light, and as you look through it, all nearby monsters become visible to you.</string>
<string name="CandleOfMindVision_Info_Exhausted">The candle has burned out, it no longer lights up when you hold it. Looks like you can\'t use it anymore.</string>
