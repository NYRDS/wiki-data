====== AI Wiki Tools and Suggestions ======

This page documents tools and suggestions that could be beneficial for AI-assisted wiki maintenance and improvement for the Remixed Dungeon wiki.

==== Current AI-Assisted Processes ====
  * Manual checking of wiki pages against codebase (Java, Lua, JSON configs)
  * Verification of game mechanics against source implementation
  * Updating of code references and string resources in wiki pages
  * Creation of missing wiki pages for entities referenced in code
  * Renaming of wiki pages to follow proper naming conventions
  * Cross-referencing between different language versions of wiki pages

==== Suggested Tools for AI-Assisted Wiki Maintenance ====

===== 1. Automated Entity Documentation Generator =====
A tool that automatically scans the codebase for entities (mobs, items, spells, etc.) and generates skeleton documentation pages with:
  * Basic stats and properties extracted from code
  * Direct links to source code files
  * References to relevant string resources
  * Suggested category classifications based on entity types

===== 2. Code-Wiki Synchronization Checker =====
A tool that regularly compares game code with wiki documentation to identify:
  * Outdated statistics or mechanics on wiki pages
  * New game features that lack wiki documentation
  * Discrepancies between implemented mechanics and documented ones

===== 3. Multi-Language Content Consistency Verifier =====
A tool that ensures content consistency across different language versions of the same wiki page, including:
  * Cross-referencing of equivalent content
  * Verification that translated pages contain the same information as source language
  * Identification of pages that exist in one language but not others

===== 4. Auto-Link Validation Tool =====
A more comprehensive version of the existing red link checker that:
  * Identifies missing pages that should exist based on codebase entities
  * Suggests appropriate wiki page names for missing entities
  * Validates that all code references in wiki pages still exist in the current codebase

===== 5. Wiki Syntax and Style Checker =====
A tool for ensuring consistency in wiki formatting that checks for:
  * Consistent heading structures
  * Proper use of tags and categories
  * Consistent formatting of data tables
  * Proper naming conventions for page files

===== 6. Automated Image/Asset Linker =====
A tool that:
  * Matches game sprites with appropriate wiki pages
  * Generates proper DokuWiki image syntax
  * Suggests image positioning in wiki content
  * Verifies existing image links are still valid

==== Implementation Suggestions ====
  * Integration with CI/CD pipeline to automatically check for wiki inconsistencies
  * Regular automated reports of wiki health statistics
  * Integration with GitHub Actions for automated wiki maintenance tasks
  * APIs or tools that allow AI agents to contribute to wiki maintenance directly

==== AI Integration Opportunities ====
  * Natural language processing to extract more detailed information from code comments
  * Machine learning models trained on existing wiki content to suggest new content
  * Automated translation verification between different language versions
  * Intelligent suggestions for content improvements based on player questions or forum discussions
