====== AI Wiki Tools and Suggestions ======

This page documents tools and suggestions that could be beneficial for AI-assisted wiki maintenance and improvement for the Remixed Dungeon wiki.

==== Current AI-Assisted Processes ====
  * Manual checking of wiki pages against codebase (Java, Lua, JSON configs)
  * Verification of game mechanics against source implementation
  * Updating of code references and string resources in wiki pages
  * Creation of missing wiki pages for entities referenced in code
  * Renaming of wiki pages to follow proper naming conventions
  * Cross-referencing between different language versions of wiki pages

==== Suggested Tools for AI-Assisted Wiki Maintenance ====

===== 1. Automated Entity Documentation Generator =====
A tool that automatically scans the codebase for entities (mobs, items, spells, etc.) and generates skeleton documentation pages with:
  * Basic stats and properties extracted from code
  * Direct links to source code files
  * References to relevant string resources
  * Suggested category classifications based on entity types

===== 2. Code-Wiki Synchronization Checker =====
A tool that regularly compares game code with wiki documentation to identify:
  * Outdated statistics or mechanics on wiki pages
  * New game features that lack wiki documentation
  * Discrepancies between implemented mechanics and documented ones

===== 3. Multi-Language Content Consistency Verifier =====
A tool that ensures content consistency across different language versions of the same wiki page, including:
  * Cross-referencing of equivalent content
  * Verification that translated pages contain the same information as source language
  * Identification of pages that exist in one language but not others

===== 4. Auto-Link Validation Tool =====
A more comprehensive version of the existing red link checker that:
  * Identifies missing pages that should exist based on codebase entities
  * Suggests appropriate wiki page names for missing entities
  * Validates that all code references in wiki pages still exist in the current codebase

===== 5. Wiki Syntax and Style Checker =====
A tool for ensuring consistency in wiki formatting that checks for:
  * Consistent heading structures
  * Proper use of tags and categories
  * Consistent formatting of data tables
  * Proper naming conventions for page files

===== 6. Automated Image/Asset Linker =====
A tool that:
  * Matches game sprites with appropriate wiki pages
  * Generates proper DokuWiki image syntax
  * Suggests image positioning in wiki content
  * Verifies existing image links are still valid

==== Implementation Suggestions ====
  * Integration with CI/CD pipeline to automatically check for wiki inconsistencies
  * Regular automated reports of wiki health statistics
  * Integration with GitHub Actions for automated wiki maintenance tasks
  * APIs or tools that allow AI agents to contribute to wiki maintenance directly

==== AI Integration Opportunities ====
  * Natural language processing to extract more detailed information from code comments
  * Machine learning models trained on existing wiki content to suggest new content
  * Automated translation verification between different language versions
  * Intelligent suggestions for content improvements based on player questions or forum discussions

==== Additional Tool Suggestions from January 2026 Maintenance ====

===== MR Namespace Generator =====
  * A script that automatically generates missing mr: namespace pages based on entity lists
  * Should be able to scan the codebase and generate basic pages with code references
  * Should follow the pattern: {entity_name}_{type} (e.g., skeleton_mob, ankh_item, heal_spell, burning_buff)
  * During this maintenance session, we identified the need for more comprehensive mr: namespace pages for various entities

===== Auto-Linker Tool =====
  * A script that identifies terms in wiki pages that have corresponding wiki pages and adds appropriate links
  * Should avoid creating duplicate links
  * Should be configurable to follow the proper naming conventions
  * This tool would help maintain consistency in internal linking as the wiki grows

===== Content Consistency Checker =====
  * Validates that all wiki pages follow the established format
  * Checks for proper code references in "Code References" sections
  * Verifies that pages contain appropriate DokuWiki syntax
  * Could be implemented as a linter for DokuWiki syntax compliance

===== Statistics Generator =====
  * Provides metrics on wiki completeness (coverage of game entities)
  * Tracks pages that lack code references
  * Monitors update frequency and outdated content
  * Would help identify areas of the wiki needing attention

===== Automated Redlink Resolver =====
  * More sophisticated than current redlink checker
  * Suggests similar pages that might have been intended
  * Provides templates for creation of missing pages
  * During this session, we confirmed that most internal links were valid

===== Code Change Tracker =====
  * Tool that monitors git changes in the codebase
  * Suggests wiki pages that might need updates based on code changes
  * Could be integrated into CI/CD to flag potential documentation gaps
  * Especially useful for tracking when game mechanics change in updates

===== Automated Naming Convention Enforcer =====
  * Tool that automatically checks and potentially fixes file naming inconsistencies
  * Validates that all pages follow the snake_case with appropriate suffixes (_mob, _item, _spell, etc.)
  * Could run as a pre-commit hook to prevent naming issues
  * During this session, we had to manually fix several naming issues (beehive.txt → beehive_mob.txt, scorpio.txt → scorpio_mob.txt, etc.)

===== Multi-Language Link Consistency Tool =====
  * Ensures that links to other language versions of pages are consistent and properly placed
  * Checks that cross-language links are appropriately positioned (typically at the bottom of pages)
  * Verifies that when an English page is updated, related language pages are checked for consistency

==== Implementation Priority ====

  1. **MR Namespace Generator** - Addresses the most glaring information gap
  2. **Auto-Linker Tool** - Would significantly improve navigation and cross-referencing
  3. **Content Consistency Checker** - Ensures quality and uniformity
  4. **Statistics Generator** - Provides visibility into wiki completeness
  5. **Automated Redlink Resolver** - Enhancement of existing functionality
  6. **Code Change Tracker** - Advanced feature for ongoing maintenance

==== Additional Resources Needed ====

  * **Entity Database**:
    - A comprehensive list of all in-game entities (mobs, items, spells, buffs, etc.)
    - Should be generated from code/config files to ensure completeness
    - Would serve as a checklist for wiki completeness

  * **Game Data API**:
    - A standardized way to extract game data for documentation
    - Would make it easier to auto-generate parts of wiki pages
    - Could also serve the game client for in-game help or tooltips

  * **Template System**:
    - Template files for different types of wiki pages
    - Would ensure consistency while making creation of new pages easier
    - Templates should be easily customizable but enforce essential sections
