==== Additional Suggestions from Recent Maintenance ====
  * **Dedicated Code Reference Tool**: A tool that can automatically scan Java/JSON/Lua files and add appropriate GitHub links to wiki pages, similar to what was manually performed in recent updates
  * **Red Link Prevention Tool**: A tool that validates all internal links refer to existing pages, preventing the creation of new red links during edits
  * **Wiki Naming Convention Validator**: Automated checker to ensure all page names follow the snake_case convention with appropriate suffixes (_mob, _item, _spell, etc.)
  * **Content Accuracy Verifier**: Tool that periodically checks game mechanics described in wiki pages against current source code to identify outdated information
  * **Batch Update Tool**: Tool that can systematically update multiple pages at once (e.g., replacing code: namespace links with proper GitHub references)
  * **Duplicate Content Detection Tool**: Enhanced algorithm to identify actual content duplication rather than just similarity scores, focusing on pages that might be unnecessarily split or merged
  * **Page Move/Rename Tool**: Automated system to properly rename wiki pages and update all references to them, similar to the manual process performed for the Fortune Teller NPC
  * **Multi-Language Consistency Tool**: Tool to ensure that content changes in the English version are reflected appropriately in Russian and other language versions
  * **Entity Kind Reference Tool**: Tool to automatically verify that wiki pages include the correct getEntityKind() method name and link to appropriate JSON configuration files (e.g., mobsDesc/{entityKind}.json)
  * **String Resource Link Generator**: Tool to automatically find and add links to appropriate string resources in values/strings_all.xml for names, descriptions, and other in-game text referenced in wiki pages
  * **Code Verification Assistant**: Tool to cross-reference wiki information with method implementations, field values, and constants in Java/Lua files to ensure accuracy of stats, mechanics, and behaviors
  * **Auto-Wikifier**: Tool to automatically add appropriate internal wiki links when creating or updating pages based on existing page names and relationships

==== Recent Task Insights ====
  * **Large-Scale Wiki Audit Tool**: Tool to perform comprehensive audits of wiki content similar to the manual verification process performed across multiple pages, checking:
    * Content accuracy against source code (Java, Lua, JSON)
    * Proper inclusion of code references and GitHub links
    * Adherence to naming conventions
    * Correct use of DokuWiki syntax
    * Proper internal linking and absence of red links
  * **Batch Verification Script**: A script that can take a list of wiki pages and systematically verify them against the codebase, extracting stats and mechanics directly from source code for comparison with wiki content
  * **Wiki Quality Metrics Tool**: Tool to measure wiki completeness, accuracy, and quality by checking for missing pages, outdated information, and content gaps compared to the game's actual implementation
  * **Content Discrepancy Discovery Tool**: Tool that can automatically compare information in wiki pages with actual implementation in code and flag inconsistencies (like the incorrect stats on the Swarm mob page or the non-existent "Item Action Buff" that was actually an interface)
  * **Page Renaming Tool**: Automated tool to rename wiki pages while properly updating all internal references to the old page name, preventing broken links (similar to the manual process used to rename item_action_buff.txt to item_action_interface.txt)
  * **Entity Type Classification Tool**: Tool to ensure pages are created with proper entity type suffixes (_mob, _item, _spell, _buff, etc.) based on the game entity being documented
  * **Automated Page Creation Tool**: System to automatically generate new wiki pages for missing entities found in the game code, following proper templates and conventions

  * **Multi-Repository Synchronization Tool**: Tool to keep the wiki content synchronized with the main game repository, ensuring that when new game entities are added, wiki pages are automatically generated or at least flagged for creation
  * **Code-to-Wiki Mapping Tool**: Tool that can identify game entities in source code and create corresponding wiki pages or update existing ones with proper entity kind references and links to JSON configuration files
  * **Mechanical Accuracy Verifier**: Tool to specifically verify that subclass abilities, item mechanics, mob behaviors and other gameplay mechanics are accurately represented in wiki content (like the Witchdoctor subclass which was incorrectly described as focusing on necromancy when it actually creates mana shields when casting spells)
  * **Naming Convention Validator**: Tool to automatically check and enforce the proper naming convention (snake_case with appropriate suffixes like _item, _mob, _spell) for all wiki pages
  * **Multi-Language Consistency Checker**: Tool to ensure that content in different languages (English, Russian, etc.) is consistent and up-to-date, particularly for game mechanics that have been updated in the source code

==== Specific Tools for Handling Large-Scale Wiki Maintenance ====
  * **Redlink Population Tool**: A specialized tool that takes the output of find_red_links.py and systematically creates stub pages for all missing references, as performed in the recent maintenance task
  * **Batch Content Verification Tool**: Tool that can be used to systematically verify multiple wiki pages against their codebase counterparts, ensuring that stats, mechanics, and descriptions are accurate
  * **Duplicate Resolution Tool**: Tool to identify and resolve duplicated content (like the armor.txt vs armor_item.txt issue identified in the recent task)
  * **Git Submodule Update Tool**: Automated process to regularly update wiki-data submodule to latest master, as performed in the initial steps of recent maintenance
  * **Automated Page Creation Workflow**: System that takes the most frequently referenced missing pages from redlink reports and automatically creates basic page structures with proper DokuWiki syntax and suggested content based on related code files
  * **Naming Convention Enforcement Tool**: Automated tool to scan for and fix pages that don't follow the proper naming convention (snake_case with entity type suffixes like _mob, _item, _spell, etc.), as was manually done renaming lich.txt to lich_subclass.txt and others during recent maintenance
  * **Code Reference Integration Tool**: Tool to automatically add appropriate GitHub links to source code, JSON configs, and string resources based on the entity being documented, similar to the manual process of adding code references to pages during recent verification
