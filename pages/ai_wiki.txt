====== AI-Assisted Wiki Maintenance Tools ======

This page documents suggestions for additional tools that could enhance AI-assisted wiki maintenance for Remixed Dungeon.

==== Current State ====
The Remixed Dungeon wiki currently uses a combination of manual content creation and some automated tools to maintain consistency and accuracy. The wiki follows specific naming conventions and requires verification against the game source code.

==== Suggested Tools ====

==== 1. Automated Content Verification Tool ====
  * **Purpose**: Automatically checks wiki content against game code to ensure accuracy
  * **Features**:
  * Compares stats listed in wiki pages with values in Java/Lua/JSON source
  * Flags discrepancies between wiki and game mechanics
  * Regular scheduled checks to ensure content stays current
  * Integration with CI/CD pipeline to check changes before merging

==== 2. Wiki Link Validator ====
  * **Purpose**: Enhanced tooling to detect and fix broken links, missing pages, and naming convention violations
  * **Features**:
  * Real-time validation of internal links
  * Automatic suggestions for similar page names
  * Integration with the existing [[code:tools/py-tools/find_red_links.py|find_red_links.py]] tool
  * Automated creation of stub pages for missing links

==== 3. AI-Powered Content Generator ====
  * **Purpose**: Assist in creating basic page templates based on game entities
  * **Features**:
  * Generate basic wiki page structure based on Java class or JSON config
  * Extract relevant information directly from source code
  * Pre-populate common sections like stats, descriptions, and references
  * Follow proper naming conventions automatically

==== 4. Image Processing Pipeline ====
  * **Purpose**: Automated processing of game sprites for wiki use
  * **Features**:
  * Scaling sprites to appropriate sizes for web viewing
  * Adding consistent borders or backgrounds
  * Automatic naming based on wiki conventions
  * Integration with the existing [[code:tools/py-tools/scale_sprites_for_wiki.py|scale_sprites_for_wiki.py]]

==== 5. Translation Consistency Checker ====
  * **Purpose**: Ensure that translated content matches the original English version
  * **Features**:
  * Compares Russian and other language versions with English source
  * Flags outdated translations
  * Helps maintain consistency across language versions

==== 6. Entity Relationship Mapper ====
  * **Purpose**: Visualize relationships between game entities
  * **Features**:
  * Shows connections between items, mobs, spells, and mechanics
  * Highlights missing relationships in wiki content
  * Generates visual graphs of game systems

==== 7. Automated Documentation Generator ====
  * **Purpose**: Generate documentation from code comments and structure
  * **Features**:
  * Extracts documentation directly from Java code comments
  * Creates API documentation for developers
  * Identifies undocumented game mechanics
  * Synchronizes game changes with documentation automatically

==== Implementation Priorities ====
  1. **Automated Content Verification Tool**: Highest priority for maintaining accuracy

  2. **Wiki Link Validator**: Important for maintaining navigability

  3. **AI-Powered Content Generator**: Useful for scaling content creation

  4. **Image Processing Pipeline**: Needed for better visual content

  5. **Translation Consistency Checker**: Important for internationalization

  6. **Entity Relationship Mapper**: Valuable for understanding complex systems

  7. **Batch Wiki Update Tool**: For performing systematic updates across multiple pages at once (e.g., adding code references, updating naming schemes, fixing broken links)

==== Technical Considerations ====
  * Tools should be implemented in Python to align with existing tooling
  * Integration with GitHub Actions for automated checks
  * Easy to run locally for contributors
  * Proper error handling and logging
  * Respectful of API limits when checking external resources
  * Integration with git workflows to enable safe batch modifications
  * Backup/snapshot mechanisms before performing bulk operations
